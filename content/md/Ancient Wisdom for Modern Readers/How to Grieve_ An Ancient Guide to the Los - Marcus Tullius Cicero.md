ACKNOWL EDGMENTS

Times change, and not always because we want them to. When things fall apart, the Stoics, the original grief counselors, counseled fortitude. 

In exploring their ideas, I would like to thank George Thomas, who writes under the name Quintus Curtius, for insight, encouragement, and advice. I also thank Tad Brennan and Charles Brittain for sharing their expertise on Plato with me, Rob Tempio for taking this proj ect on, and my mother, Maryanne, who was a valuable sounding board from the beginning. 

My greatest debt is to Alyssa. As Job said \(17:12\), *Et rursum post tenebras spero lucem. *

And again after darkness I hope for the day.

INTRODUCTION

The Lost Art of Consolation

After a stratospheric year as Consul, Marcus Tullius Cicero was on top of the Roman world. Five years later, that world had turned on him. He was ostracized, pressured into exile, his property confiscated or destroyed. He spent a year and a half wandering, aimless and adrift. A de cade later, his wife left him. He immediately married again, but badly, and only for the money.1

Rock bottom, though, had yet to come. In 45 

BCE, his beloved daughter Tullia died from complications of childbirth. She was only 32. 

Familiar questions began to haunt him. *Is there* *life after death? Are our loved ones in heaven? How* *could things go so wrong? * And, perhaps most press-ing of all, *Is there any way to recover from something* *as earth- shattering as the death of a child? *

The prob lem, as every ancient thinker empha-sizes, is Fortune: luck, chance, randomness, circumstances beyond our control. Looking back three xiii

INTRODUCTION

and a half centuries later, the Christian convert Lactantius was impressed by how courageously Cicero had fought back all his life— right up to the moment he couldn’t any longer:

In his *Consolation*, Marcus Tullius says he always fought Fortune and won, in thwarting his enemies’ attacks. She didn’t break him even when he’d been chased from home and homeland. Then, though, when he lost his dearest daughter, he shamefully admits that Fortune has defeated him: “I give up,” he says. “It’s over.”2

The death of a child can do that. It can make a person fall to pieces. As Cicero put it elsewhere \( *Tusculan Disputations* 3.61\), People whose grief is so great that they’re falling to pieces and can’t hold together should be supported by all kinds of assistance. That’s why the Stoics think grief is called *lupe*, since it’s a 

“disso *lu* tion” of the whole person. 

In the text to which Lactantius refers, the *Consolation*, Cicero did something he later boasted no one had ever done before. “I hacked Nature,” he declares, “and talked *myself* out of depression.”3

xiv 

INTRODUCTION

The idea of a *self*- consolation is familiar from many later writers, from Marcus Aurelius to Augustine to Boethius. At the time, however, it was something new in world lit er a ture, equal parts philosophy and motivational speech. It seems history’s greatest speaker put all his powers of persuasion to convince an audience of one— himself—to get past his grief and move on. 

And, says Cicero, it worked. 

*Effigiem oris, sermonis, animi mei* She’s exactly like me— face, speech, heart and soul. 

— Cicero, *Letter to Quintus*, 1.3/3.3

Who was Tullia Ciceronis? As far as we can tell, she was an extraordinary woman who was born into extraordinary circumstances. Yet her life was not the fairy tale it should have been. 

Born in 78 BCE, Cicero’s only daughter found herself widowed at age 20. She remarried at 22, then divorced and remarried again at 27, to a bad husband. That third marriage produced one stillbirth, little love, and a second divorce a few years later—

while Tullia was pregnant. In January 45, at the age of 32, she gave birth to a boy, but the baby did not xv

INTRODUCTION

live. The next month, Tullia herself died of complications at her father’s country villa. 

Throughout this life of disappointments, Tullia radiated strength and resilience. Cicero repeatedly praised her fortitude, and even chose a strange word to describe it: *virtus*, greatness or manfulness— a word which, thanks to its root in the word for a man or hero \( *vir*\), had never been applied to a woman before. Cicero saw his daughter as a hero, a saint. 

When she died, therefore, he was sure she was in heaven— was *up* there, looking down, happy, safe, and waiting for him. That she, and eventually he, would live forever. 

All this sounds very Christian, and it is, in no small part because the Christian notion of heaven is indebted, like Cicero, more to Platonic philosophy than to the Judaism from which it sprang. Re-gardless of our religion, though, these thoughts will be familiar to all of us who have lost a loved one. It has always been so. In the face of unremitting misery, as the Enlightenment thinker Voltaire asked in his *Homily on Atheism*, 

what position does there remain for us to take? 

Is it not the one taken by all the scholars of antiquity in India, Chaldea, Greece, Rome, that of believing that God will cause us to pass from this xvi 

INTRODUCTION

unhappy life to a better one, which will be the development of our nature?4

Moreover, like so many bereft parents, Cicero re-solved to build a shrine to his beloved daughter. 

Unlike most, however, he wanted the “shrine” to be an * actual* shrine— a church, we would call it today—

with Tullia herself literally worshipped as a god. He began making plans to make it happen. 

But it never came to pass. Perhaps such plans were just a part of his grieving pro cess. 

*Fortīs Fortuna adiuvat. *

Fortune favors fortitude. 

— Roman proverb 

\(Terence, *Phormio* 203, cited by Cicero\)

“Stoicism,” says Peter Breggin, “is a philosophy for someone going down in an airplane.” When Cicero needed help, he was going down in an airplane. He turned to the wisdom of ancient Greece for answers. 

In the weeks following Tullia’s death, Cicero read and reread classic philosophical treatises on coping with grief. By his time, “consolatory lit er ature” was an established genre. The finest examples to reach us are three letters by Seneca, a Stoic, and xvii

INTRODUCTION

two by Plutarch, a Platonist, but those all lay generations in the future. In Cicero’s time, the greatest guide to bereavement— cited several times in the text translated here— was a treatise by Crantor of Soli \(d. 276 BCE\). That treatise is lost today, but traces of it appear in later consolatory lit er a ture by Plutarch and Cicero himself, especially his *Tusculan Disputations*, which he wrote very soon after the *Consolation*.5 And we know enough about Crantor’s treatise to realize its coping strategies and grief therapies are nothing like practices commonly recommended today. 

Grieving today is collective and often analyzed as a series of stages. For Crantor, as for the Stoics who refined his ideas, it is a matter of individuals finding the inner strength to accept real ity—or comforting illusions— and moving on. Cold logic will convince us that death is part of life, indeed better than life, and that we’re nothing special: tragedy and loss are inherent in the human condition. 

Others have survived it before us, which means we can, too. Resilience, endurance, and individual effort, therefore, are the way forward. 

These ideas may sound harsh and alienating. For Cicero, they were his path out of despair. After studying these models, he sat down and wrote his *Consolation* in just a matter of weeks. He had a first xviii 

INTRODUCTION

draft by March 11, 45 BCE, and a final draft just a week or two later. His essay would go on to become one of the great masterpieces of the ancient world, a new standard and source of solace and relief for centuries. 

The reputation of your works is im mense; your name is on every one’s lips; but your serious students are few, whether because the times are unpropitious or because men’s wits are dull and sluggish, or, as I think more likely, because greed diverts our minds to other ends. Thus some of your books have perished, I suspect, within the time of men now living; and I do not know if they will ever be recovered. This is a great grief to me. . . . Here are the names of your lost books: the *Republic*, *On Familiar Matters*, *On the* *Military Art*, *In Praise of Philosophy*, *On* *Consolation*, *On Glory*. . . . 

— Petrarch, *Letter to Cicero*, 24.4 

\(December 1345\), trans. Morris Bishop Cicero’s *Consolation* was lost in antiquity. At some point during or after the fourth century, it dis-appeared, leaving us no more than a dozen quotations by other authors.

INTRODUCTION

In 1583, however, as the Re nais sance was coming to an end in Italy, a new book quietly appeared in shops in Venice. It contained the text translated in this volume, and its title page carried a sensational announcement:

The *Consolation* of Marcus Tullius Cicero, the book whereby he consoled himself on the death of his daughter, newly rediscovered and published. 

Was it real? A forgery? A prank? Nobody knew, and nobody would say. The book contained no introduction and offered no explanation of where this trea sure came from. 

And its contents were astonishing. The text contained all the known fragments of Cicero’s lost *Consolation* and innumerable points of contact with other relevant texts in the same consolatory tradition. It included many examples of famous Romans who endured grief, examples that Cicero had made inquiries about in con temporary letters to his friends. Much of the content matches what we find in the *Tusculan Disputations*, a text Cicero began writing very soon after. And the style itself is highly Ciceronian. 

Skeptics emerged immediately, but to all ap-pearances the text was real. For centuries it was xx 

INTRODUCTION

included among Cicero’s collected works, albeit with a note indicating that many believed it was a forgery. Most scholars have come to agree with this, but defenses appeared sporadically. In 1999, a computer program was fi nally devised to assess stylometrics— that is, the relative frequency across a range of texts of “function” words, like *et* \(and\) or *in* \(in\) or *est* \(is\), to determine authenticity.6 The computer crunched the numbers and determined that the text was prob ably not au then tic. 

It is not au then tic. Despite all that effort, amazingly, in four and a half centuries no one ever bothered to fact- check a block quote attributed to Plato in section 57. Anyone who had would have learned, as did I, that it comes not from Plato but from Marsilio Ficino’s popu lar *Life of Plato*, first published in Italy in 1477 and frequently reprinted during the Re nais sance.7 It is not clear whether that false quotation was a blunder, or \(as I think\) a deliberate trap, akin to the “trap streets” that cartographers include on maps to protect their intellectual property. 

Either way, the case is closed. 

Who *did* write our treatise, then? Suspicion has traditionally devolved on the Modenese historian Charles Sigonius \(Carlo Sigonio, 1524–1584\). After reviewing all the evidence, I’m not so sure, though it does seem likely he knew who did— and refused to say.8

INTRODUCTION

It doesn’t matter, though, because not all fakes are fake in the same way. *This* fake is not a fabrication, but a *recreation*. It is Cicero refined and dis-tilled and concentrated. Some parts are taken almost verbatim from Cicero’s other works, and his spirit and thought infuse the entire text. Not a word is inconsistent with his philosophy. 

Furthermore, it’s clear that the forger combed every single one of Cicero’s philosophical essays, as well as the entire consolatory tradition, in assembling this essay. One can imagine the forger copy-ing relevant passages onto notecards, spreading them out on a table, and then carefully assembling them into a coherent whole. The result is akin to the best historical fiction of Robert Harris. 

Scholars today estimate the original *Consolation* was only around 20–40 pages long, which is to say, no more than a third to half the length of our fake one. Yet the themes it covered were identical: the therapeutic value of philosophy, the value of role models, competing views of the human condition, and belief in the immortality of the soul— especially Tullia’s soul.9 In that regard, our *Consolation* offers us a more accurate view of what Cicero prob ably wrote than any academic article on the topic ever could. 

The resulting text is nothing short of a masterpiece of recreation and imitation. It seems to xxii 

INTRODUCTION

experiment with a stream- of- consciousness style that reflects Cicero’s wavering mindset. It also offers one of the most forthright reflections on the plight and hardships of women to be found anywhere before the nineteenth century. 

It is no won der, then, that despite its origins, many have found this text a source of enormous relief, and, as Cicero intended, consolation. 

A Note on the Text and Translation The Latin text is based on Klotz 1876, though I’ve repunctuated it as I did in *How to Tell a Joke*. I have also suggested a few emendations \(in sections 86, 122, 125, 139, 144, 189, 208, 214, and the deletion in 99\). In 89, 90, and 99, I adopt emendations suggested by other scholars that are not reported by Klotz. The genuine fragments of Cicero’s *Consolation* are printed in **bold** and numbered according to Vitelli’s edition of 1979. 

The only prior En glish translation is that of Blacklock 1767. Among the five French translations I discovered, I am indebted to that of Mangeart 1840 for several insightful interpretations and turns of phrase. 

The subheadings in the translation are my own addition. Other wise, notes in this edition are kept xxiii

Preamble

CONSOLATION— *SELF*- CONSOLATION— IS MY 

ONLY HOPE

\[1\] I know the experts say not to treat *recent* traumas, and that in human life, no tragedy should strike us as surprising or unexpected. Still, though, I have to try—if there’s any pos si ble way—to *fix* myself, and stop my world from caving in. 

I mean, if I always counseled others when it hit, then why *not* myself? And if I’ve absorbed horrors that human strength was powerless to avoid or avert, then why not—if I possibly can— use *reason* to relieve them? People *should* block out heartache and grief, block them just as fiercely as a life without worries is preferable to a prison of stress and anxiety, or to making the human condition— hard enough as it is— even harder with *new* prob lems. 

\[2\] Besides, when you have physical health, what’s more crucial or beneficial than looking after your mental health? The body needs the heart’s governance, and the heart, the body’s labor. But an aching 3

\[3\] Quamobrem, prudenter a doctis et sapientibus viris et cogitatum et factum est, qui de luctu minuendo ante nos scripserunt; quorum exstant satis multa— sane sapienter litteris mandata— inprimisque a Theophrasto, Xenocrate et Crantore; quorum libros quúm saepe animi causā sumpserimus in manūs, admirati eorum saluberrimis praeceptis refertam et condītam eloquentiam, túm proxime lēgimus necessariò. \[4\] Casus enim ereptae nobis filiae, quam in oculis ferebamus, eximiis et virtutis et prudentiae laudibus praestantem, ita nos vel perculit vel adflixit ut ab iis opem ad leniendum et mitigandum dolorem petere coacti simus, quorum maxime doctrinā atque auctoritate antea movebamur. 

Itaque, multa quae ab illis vel acute cogitata vel eleganter enuntiata sunt ad dolorem nostrum abstergendum colligemus ut, si minus ceteros in tanto maerore delectare poterimus, quod aliàs et dicendo et scribendo efficere conati sumus et fortasse interdum praestitimus, saltem nobis ipsis medeamur. \[5\] Sed nos etiam in hoc fortiores erimus quàm ceteri, quibus difficile non fuit—

heart is a poor governor, and a disabled body cannot obey the heart’s directives properly. 

\[3\] That real ity demonstrates the insightfulness of those enlightened thinkers, my pre de ces sors, who wrote about coping with grief. A number of their efforts, which they were wise enough to write down, are extant. The main ones are those of Theophrastus, Xenocrates, and Crantor, and I’d often picked their books up for fun; I admired their engaging style, witty and packed with helpful man-tras.10 Now, though, I’m reading them of necessity, 

\[4\] because the shock of seeing my daughter torn from me—my beautiful darling, a paragon of heroism and wisdom— has crushed me, devastated me. 

I need *help* to blunt or mask the pain, and I find myself forced to seek it from those authorities whose expertise always so impressed me in the past. 

To wipe away the pain, therefore, I will collect many of their insights and quotable sayings. That way, even if I fail to please others in my grief— 

which on other occasions my speeches and writ-ings have tried, and sometimes perhaps even managed to do— then at least I’ll fix myself. \[5\] And in so doing, I’ll be even *stronger* than my pre de ces-sors. They weren’t grieving themselves, so it wasn’t hard for them to console other people and spirit them out of mourning. *I*, however, will find consolation within *myself*: though stricken with grief, 5

Qui enim hominem se esse agnoscit hominisque nomen sibi vindicat, ¿cur ea quae hominis maxime propria sunt, recusare ac reiicere audeat? 

Quod simul ut fecisset, et imprudens et iniustus meritò haberetur. \[6\] Atque hic locus a Theophrasto egregie tractatus et perpolitus est, itemque a Xenocrate, quorum uterque eos qui communes casūs recusant, imprudentiae atque iniustitiae condemnat; alter etiam dis ipsis adversos non dubitat appellare. Quod etiam gravius crimen est ac vix in homine tolerabile: qui, quum omnia dis immortalibus accepta referre debeat, quorum ope vivit, intellegit, agit, si eorum voluntati repugnet, cum dis Gigantum more bellare videbitur.

HOW TO GRIEVE

I will “hack” Nature and conquer *myself* amidst my grieving. 

I hope this effort can show others in my situation how to endure sudden losses with forbearing, since the more often tragedy strikes, the more intimately * human* we must think tragedies are. We must think of them as virtually congenital, bound up with human nature, and hence, for that reason, easier to endure. I mean, if you accept and pride yourself on being human, then how could you possibly reject and refuse a chief condition of being human? 

The moment you do *that*, moreover, you’d rightly be seen as shortsighted and acting in bad faith. 

\[6\] Theophrastus is subtle and superb on this issue, as is Xenocrates; both expose the shortsightedness and bad faith of those who bridle at life’s inevitabil-ities. One of them even declares such people “anti-God,” since theirs constitutes a heinous and wildly inappropriate stance for a human being: namely, that if instead of *thanking* for all your blessings those immortal gods who gave you life, intelligence, and action, you *fight* their decisions. It suggests that, like the Giants, you’re going to war against the gods. 

\[7\] Well, a lot of people have written about these matters carefully, as I said, but **I like Crantor**. I read his book *Grief*, and though it’s short, it’s solid gold. Panaetius was right: every word is worth 7

Nam infantiam et pueritiam vagitus, lacrimae, imbecillitas, nullus nec rationis nec corporis usus, dolores molestiaeque quàm plurimae amplectuntur. 

Adolescentiam ardor quidam excipit aetatis— nec prudentiae nec iudicii compos— , rerum utilium ac laudabilium contemptio, voluptatis et saepe turpitudinis appetitio, veri boni ignoratio, in pares ferocia, in superiores superbia, in infimos adrogantia. \[9\] Ex his, contentiones, rixae, contumeliae, adsiduus denique molestiarum concursus exsistit; ex rebus honestis contemptis, infelicitas et infamia; ex turpibus curiose adreptis et conquisitis, luctus, morbi, perpetuum denique sui ipsius odium, ex cognitā rerum turpium mercede conflatum. \[10\] Adde 8

The Miseries of Man

THE STAGES OF LIFE

\[8\] I mean, picture man born and put into the world. 

Instantly you’ll see he arrives, not the master and monarch of human affairs, but the slave of misfortune and misery. Infancy and childhood are spent in crying, tears, weakness, cognitive and physical helplessness, and infinite pain and prob lems. 

Adolescence gets overtaken by a characteristic flush— shortsighted, headstrong— and a disdain for practicality and honor, by an eagerness for plea sure \(often *shameful* plea sure\), and a blind eye to what’s right. It’s cruel to peers, arrogant toward authority, and obnoxious to those below. \[9\] That attitude leads to arguing, fistfights, and verbal abuse— 

essentially, one headache after another. Disdain for honor begets failures and embarrassment; the free-wheeling hunt for sensuality leads to grief, traumas, and endless self- loathing, all of it caused by recognizing the wages of your sins. \[10\] Add in the 9

“nature,” then you’ll be quibbling over nomencla-ture, sure, but you won’t do a thing to excise the miseries and prob lems from the man. \[11\] Ignore, too, anyone who thinks they must be separated from the miseries of human nature, because “they aren’t congenital, no, they’re failings of the *individual*, or of just some people,” while claiming prob lems intrinsic to *Nature* are those that are absolutely inseparable from *any* man.

As if it were *not* human to lose your temper simply because *many* people don’t lose their temper, or *not* human to talk and participate in society simply because you can find many people who think the hardest thing in life is getting together or having a conversation with someone. \[12\] They really *are* human miseries, though, since even if not all of them are attested in *one* person, they’re certainly all attested in all people, and some are in many and many are often attested in one person. 

When you’re established in life, it isn’t hard to understand the *number* or *intensity* of the miseries. It’s almost impossible to list them all, though, since this stage more than any other meets with heartaches and hazards to your life, reputation, and 11

This is the stage that looks after friends’ private affairs, that undertakes public ser vice, that experiences the glory and fruits of success, and that experiences the hardships and frus-trations of failure. This is the time for championing the good and prosecuting the wicked. It’s targeted for jealousy and competition from the good, and for sabotage from the wicked. It’s a period forever fighting itself, forever restive, always preoccupied, always anxious and obsessing. If it didn’t occasionally enjoy some advantage or upside from the constant strug gles, it would simply break down. \[14\] The downsides, however, are many more, and they’re *so* miserable that they can dissuade and turn anyone off from public life. 

My own fate gave the whole country a good example of that. The thanks I got for rescuing my fellow citizens, for defending their homes, and for thwarting the traitors who held a knife to the throat of the people and re-public of Rome, was being hit with disaster.— I can handle the hardship, though, if it brought 13

And, if I had the power to extend my life, *nothing* could persuade me to live longer than the pursuit and cultivation of the common good, since *that* is the single most glorious and praiseworthy proj-ect for a human being. 

\[16\] Now as to the final stage of life, what should I say about the horrors of old age? The very name evokes languor and falling. It hints that emergencies are frequent and serious, and the very sight of old people proves it. To see an old person— trembling, stooped, timeworn, weak, frail—is that anything less than seeing a live man dying or a dead man living? 

It’s true that wisdom acquired from long experience is a privilege of that stage of life. If some see it as a great consolation of old age, though, they should admit that it’s also a major source of heartache and pain. \[17\] I mean, if you *know* you’re a wise and experienced leader and you see a best course of action, then how could it not upset you to see age *itself* 15

And wisdom itself makes the heartache worse, since you realize that the best laid plans are only as good as the best execution— and without a true patriot stepping up to act, they’re worthless. 

ON SOCIAL CLASS

\[18\] I think that’s enough about the stages of life; what should I say now about social stratification? 

Can I honestly deny that the upper, middle, and lower classes are equal in their misery? 

Consider kings. Dionysius \[ *1 of Syracuse, tyrant* *from 405–367 BCE*\] essentially proved how miserable and exposed to anxiety, dread, and plots they are when he had Damocles try out his “good fortune” 

for himself—by dangling a sword over his head. 

And no won der, since kings endlessly face looming threats of war, devastation of their territories, massacres of their subjects, and annihilation of their cities. \[19\] When war *does* break out, the winner does always add a little glory or domain, but at such a cost and with such losses that it usually would’ve been better not to take up arms in the first place. If their army *does* get routed or some disaster strikes, moreover, it’s the worst thing in the world, since it results in slavery, starvation, grief, and disgrace.

HOW TO GRIEVE

\[20\] But imagine our king far removed from the melee of war and the dirty barracks. He’s peacefully possessing his domains, with no trou ble from enemy attacks. Is he any safer or less at risk of misery? No, far from it. He’ll be his own source of stress and anxiety, since human nature cannot tolerate downtime. He’ll be contemplating an increase in taxes, or plans to extend his borders and acquire cities for his domains, or to create ties of blood or friendship with mightier men. When your heart worries about those things, you have no peace yourself, and you allow no rest to others. 

\[21\] And as for greed— the cancer of the soul— 

suffice it to say it almost invariably takes root in a lazy and idle mind, and that it’s the great and power-ful whose hearts are consumed by it the most. 

The opposite of the upper class are the lower classes. As their name implies and their abject real ity proves, they’re vulnerable to every pos si ble trauma and tragedy. They have to endure poverty, hunger, disrespect, aggressions, taxes, military disasters— 

basically, every conceivable misery. And what makes it even worse is that when something bad happens, every one else at least has resources to cushion or help cope with the pain. \[22\] But from some fatal need, Nature itself has put the lower classes into *such* an abject position that under the weight of all 19

Eoque miserior illarum status est quo mollior natura et, 20 

HOW TO GRIEVE

those miseries, there’s virtually no way for them to rise or lift themselves out. 

The middle class is by no means misery- free either. It sits between the upper and the lower classes, and hence it’s subservient to the one and stuck with the other. It’d certainly be less miserable if it could exploit the underclasses, but because it’s little better than them in dignity, while it cannot match the resources of the elites, it’s forced to be content with its status. Hence, it bears the brunt of society. True, those burdens do help run the country and they aren’t excessively heavy or hard to bear. All the same, they cause anxiety and they increase human suffering. 

\[23\] This is not the place to expand on these points; they’re obvious to every one, not least to me. 

ON WOMEN

It’s no better for women. The prob lems and anx ieties that torment them are the same as ours, or at least not much dif fer ent. They’re vulnerable to all the same traumas and heartaches and flights from real ity that men are, \[24\] and in fact their condition 21

is even *more* miserable, in that they’re naturally weaker and less capable of blocking out trauma and enduring tragedy. They suffer the same anxiety and pangs of grief that men do at the loss of parents, brothers, sisters, and relatives. They often get bum husbands whose stupidity, neglect, and blowing through money result in \[25\] poverty and grief. 

Even worse, the misery of their oppression is com-pounded because unlike men, women can’t go out and look for the means to *repair* the damage and take financial control of their situation. 

Think of the *pain* my darling Tullia felt at her father’s exile, all the grief and the prob lems that her husbands’ screw ups created\! I *know* she saw her fair share of blessings in life. But, as the very wisest among us say, the taste of a few evils is so bitter that it can neutralize a world and lifetime of blessings— and sometimes even poison it. There’s far more I’d like to say on this topic, but it’s better kept to myself. 

\[26\] All that said, there’s one reason alone that explains why the misery of women is great: namely that all their lives long, * they’re forever forced to* *obey*. They obey and owe subservience to their parents and relatives before they’re married, or to their 23

husbands once they are. Hence, the less free they are, the more miserable they are; and since they’re *never* free until they leave this life, it follows that only a dead woman must be accounted a happy woman. 

And I really don’t see what more can be said.11

BACK TO ME\(N\)

But to return to us, I say that beyond life’s ordinary tragedies, a special kind of misery burdens a man who has the good fortune to be married, since his own prob lems are not his only source of torment. 

He shares in the worries and anx i eties of his wife and family, since from her to whom he’s united in matrimony— the strongest of all bonds—he cannot be divorced in mind or thought. 

\[27\] And so, when a man’s heart is so harassed by anxiety, so surrounded by misery, what great or outstanding proj ect can he contemplate or take on? 

The *real* won der is that he doesn’t just sink down and lie on the floor in despair. 

Death Is Better than Life

MAN WAS BORN TO ATONE FOR SINS

\[28\] And so I’m back to my original point \[ *in section 7*\], that no one in existence is *not* miserable, no one is *truly* happy. **Man was born to atone for sins,** 25

Itaque, excutiatur iam et evellatur funditus falsa illa multorum opinio, malam esse mortem, quandoquidem vel deorum iudicio non modo mala non est, sed omnium rerum optima et omnium munerum quae humano generi dari possunt, praestantissima. \[31\] Praeclare: nam et miseriarum omnium quas viventes pertulimus, finis est in morte, et 26

and those who dare call him “happy” or “blessed” 

are naïve. Our **“life” is death**, and the heart or soul doesn’t begin living until it’s set free from the prison of the body, and gains eternity. \[29\] Hence, tradition has it, the immortal gods have granted death to those they love most as a benefit. 

• For example, Herodotus says \[ *Histories 1.31*\] the priestess of Argos prayed to the goddess for what was best for her sons— and found them dead, death being granted as if it were the best thing for them. 

• And we should obviously believe Apollo of Delphi. After constructing a magnificent temple to Apollo at Delphi, Trophonius and Agamedes begged him to grant them what was best for a human being— and three days later, they were found lifeless. \[30\] By that gift, the god— the *same* god to whom all others had left the role of prophecy— indicated that for a human being, death is the best thing in the world. 

So let’s banish, let’s *eradicate* the masses’ false belief that death is bad, since by the gods’ own decision not only is it *not* bad, it’s the *best* of all things, and of all rewards that humankind can receive, the greatest. \[31\] And it clearly *is*, for death marks the end of all the miseries we endured in life, and an 27

Nihil enim miserum quod non culpā contractum.” De hoc aliàs viderimus, sed calamitates certe fuerunt— quarum etiam unica cogitatio, quae praetervolat et effugit, non modo sensus, qui corpori firmius inhaeret, acerbitatis habet plurimum. 

\[32\] Ex quo, vere colligi potest sapienter fecisse Thraces, qui—si Herodoto credimus— nascentibus liberis lugere, morientibus laetari solebant. Exitum videlicet vitae ut miseriarum finem et quietis portum probabant, vitae initium ut ingressum ad molestias et dolores inviti videbant. 

\[33\] Si, ergo, nascimur miseri, morimur beati, ¿quis in hanc lucem ēdi velit ut miseriis opprimatur? ¿quis non potius mori ut beatam vitam acquirat? et, si hoc nobismet ipsis ut optimum, vellemus, ¿cur liberis et adfinibus diversum? ¿An melius nobis quàm iis quos summe diligimus esse velimus, aut potius beate nobis, misere ipsis et infeliciter? Hoc, certe nullo modo. \[34\] Quamobrem, amanda mors semper omnibus, carissimis etiam optanda. Ac, si 28

escape from all the miseries that will be suffered by those who go on living. 

Examples from history teach us that *many* excellent Romans suffered unimaginable tragedy by extending their lives. “Purely coincidental\!” someone will say, “so don’t call it ‘misery,’ because misery requires moral responsibility.” Let’s worry about that another time, because *tragedies* they surely were; a mere fleeting *thought* of them that flickers into mind is as agonizing as a lingering physical pain. 

\[32\] And that suggests the Thracians were on to something, if it really was their custom \(as Herodotus claims \[ *5.4.2*\]\) to grieve the births, and cheer the deaths, of children. They hailed life’s exit as the end of miseries and a safe haven, and regarded its beginning, halfheartedly, as a portal to heartache and pain.12

\[33\] Therefore, if we’re born miserable and we die happy, who would *want* to be born into this world? To drown in misery? Who * wouldn’t* rather die if it meant obtaining a happy life? And if we did want that— what’s “best” for ourselves— then why want any dif fer ent for our children and relatives? 

Do we want better for ourselves than our loved ones? Or rather, happiness for us, but heartache and misery for them? Of course not. \[34\] It follows, then, that every one should *love* death, always, and 29

IT’S BEST TO NEVER BE BORN

\[35\] Being *born*, though— I don’t get who it’s good for. Where’s the evidence of happiness or joy in us entering a world of misery? Isn’t it rather that we’re outraged, as the screaming and crying of newborn babies implies? Yes, because those screams are a gift of Mother Nature’s brilliance. She does nothing in vain, and in fact is always leaving proof of the love, justice, or design behind her creations.13 It’s fascinating, \[36\] and it shows why **not being born and** **hence hurled against life’s rocks is clearly the best** **option. Second best, if you do get born, is to die** **and flee the vio lence of Fortune as fast as you’d** **run from a burning building**. 

If adding folklore to serious philosophy is occa-sionally okay, then “The Story of Silenus” confirms it. 

Imprisoned by Midas, Silenus won his freedom by teaching the king that never being born is best, while dying soon comes second. A passage of Euripides, wisest of poets, makes the same point.14 \[37\] Meanwhile Crantor, our authority \[ *section 7*\], says a father shattered by his son’s death received this answer 31

What time could you possibly prefer to *that* time— which will continue in like fashion throughout the endless eons that follow? 

Alternatively, if we’d rather death be a moving on to the regions where the departed dwell, then what could be more enviable than reuniting in death with those you loved in life? Than enjoying eternal life with those whose teachings and examples so influenced us to live honorably and to die without regrets? \[40\] I can’t imagine anything more wonderful than having death open up a portal to that other place, and finding and being with those I loved most, people I could never stop loving and praising.

Indeed, to the extent that others’ heartaches prove less severe than my own agony, I suspect it will help them all the more. 

I mean, if we’re to consider a daughter’s love and devotion, her greatness, dignity, strength and all the other qualities you scarcely see, much less *look* for in a woman, then it was inevitable that grief at such a loss would shatter me. 

But consolation *must* prevail over grief. I have to stop focusing on what I’ve lost and start focusing on how far I should mourn a daughter who was 37

Death Is Part of the Human Condition

\[42\] Still, if grief is clouding anyone’s judgment and they decide that what I’ve said so far isn’t solid or reliable enough, then remember:

• You’re human. 

• Nothing is more human than death. If death could be ripped out of you and spirited away, you’d be more god than human. The name 

“ human” wouldn’t really fit you, since you’d be skipping the most universal and characteristically human experience. 

• Tears achieve nothing. If they did, you’d not only want to shed them copiously, you’d want to force them out zealously. 

• \[43\] If you grieve excessively, you’re not just misguided, you’re also disgracing yourself. That’s because disgrace is worse than grief, inasmuch as grief is a natu ral human instinct and there’s nothing shameful about it; whereas disgrace should be criticized precisely because it always entails some stain of guilt.

EXCESSIVE GRIEF IS DISGRACEFUL 

AND MISGUIDED

All excessive grief is disgraceful and unnatural because grieving excessively and unreasonably is a conscious *choice*. It engenders a weakness that men must shun and abhor, lest we become overwrought and effeminate from the kind of soft and sappy thoughts lovers are always abandoning themselves to. \[44\] No, we do better to remember the Homeric rule \[ *Odyssey 20.18*\]:

♫ *Come on, get tough, and harden your heart\! *

* Don’t surrender to grieving. *

* You’ve already endured in the past far worse and* *far graver. *♫

Human nature is so inescapably fraught with tragedy that no one, obviously, attends a loved one’s funeral without having suffered many setbacks already. So, if you’ve already powered through worse or at least as bad— where the pain you had to steel yourself for was something new— then why should you lose all hope and surrender to depression now? 

I was just saying how that’s also misguided \[ *section 43, 4*\]. You see, Nature gave us life on loan, like money, with no fixed maturity date. If she comes 41

to collect what’s hers when the whim takes her— 

*and* she lent it on condition that it be returned— 

then why criticize her? Why not instead *thank* Nature for coming later rather than sooner, instead of ranting that she’s fi nally come at all? \[45\] We *know* we’re granted a hotel room, not a permanent residence. When we check out, we should go *cheerfully*, like we’re leaving a horrible, crummy hostel. 

We should soar with the greatest optimism to our future life, like we’re heading home—as *true* sages, we’re told, have actually done. 

You see, if anything distresses the dying and leaves their relatives upset, it surely results from either:

\[ *1*\] the misguided belief that this life is better and more joyous than it is, or

\[ *2*\] our selfishness and narcissism. 

But solid arguments annihilate \[ *1*\] and we should abandon it, whereas we ought to abhor \[ *2*\] as fully as we recognize how unseemly it is, once our careers in life are over, to:

• try to stay on despite the gods’ will, 

• refuse the universal terms imposed on all who left before us, and

• be so worthless and weak that we don’t get tough and pull it together even in our final moments. 

\[46\] If it’s the death of our loved ones that’s tormenting us, then let’s reflect that:

• They had to die someday. 

• Death is uncertain and not up to man; it depends on the will of the gods. 

• Those we’re mourning watched their *own* loved ones die, and they endured it with forbearing. 

Hence, they teach us by example the be hav ior they’d have us model. 

• Fi nally—to drive home the most comforting point— *they aren’t lost or gone forever. They’ve* *just been taken somewhere we can’t see or talk to* *them a while*. 

\[47\] That means that when we too reach the end of life that Nature has prescribed, we’ll instantly taste the plea sure of their com pany again. We’ll resume our happy times—or re unite. 

DYING IS NOT PAINFUL

Some believe their loved ones’ death is painful and the pro cess agonizing, and that may be what upsets them.

Quod me quidem— sublatis gravioribus dolendi causis quas iam superiori disputatione reiecimus— minime angit. Ipse enim discessus animi a corpore vel cum nullo vel certe cum modico dolore fit, et interdum sine sensu; nonnumquam etiam, si recte sapimus, cum voluptate. 

\[48\] Sed quidquid sit, totum hoc ita leve est qualia sunt ea quae puncto temporis fiunt. 

Nec, si mors paulo longior alicui contingat, desperandum est de deorum naturaeque benignitate quin eo quoque tempore properantem e vitā discedere foveant atque adlevent. Cuius rei in morientibus saepissime signa minime dubia cernuntur; quum— velut e somno exciti—

HOW TO GRIEVE

Well, having eliminated the more impor tant reasons for grieving already \[ *sections 28–46*\], I’m not worried about that at all. You see, the departure of the soul from the body occurs without any or only mod-erate pain. Sometimes there’s no feeling at all, and occasionally—if we’re not mistaken— it’s even pleas urable. \[48\] Whichever it is, though, the whole thing’s as minor as anything that’s over with in a second. 

If death *does* take some a little longer, we mustn’t fail to trust that the goodness of the gods and of Nature are continuing to provide nurture and comfort in their strug gle to die. We often see unmistak-able signs of that in the dying. The moment they’re about to breathe their last, they gaze up, like people waking up from sleep, so happy and so bright that you’d swear they’re enjoying leaving life. 

\[49\] Hence, even that concern can’t really justify grief. No: you have to *repress* grief, *overcome* it— 

because in time, it does thin out and dis appear, even if you’d rather it not. It’s not that time itself possesses the power to overcome grief; it’s simply that habit and daily reflection teach us that there’s nothing bad about death, and hence we should endure it lightly and patiently. 

\[50\] When a man’s seen so much, though, it’s shameful and stupid to wait for habit and reflection to supply remedies for his grief 47

THE PSYCHOTHERAPEUTIC VALUE OF PHILOSOPHY

The foregoing arguments \[ *sections 42–49*\] are so solid and reliable that every one will, I believe, find them not just enormously helpful, but persuasive. 

Moreover, I needed them *myself*, given the shame I felt that *I*— always a staunch consoler of others— 

was para lyzed with grief. I knew I’d hear the taunt, and perhaps with justice, 

♫ *Is* this *the selfsame Cicero* *whose eloquence Greek gazes turned to meet?\!? *♫

What’s fortified me against every pitfall of circumstance and fortune and nature, though, is philosophy. Philosophy is so mighty that she cowers before no assault; so sweet and gentle that she soothes and eases every heartache; and so generous and wonderful that she lends and extends her whole self to human pro gress. 

\[51\] And that’s as it should be. I mean, Philosophy knows mankind’s accumulated miseries intimately and diagnoses them precisely. If she let them fester when a man’s wracked with grief, if she were 49

unavailable as counselor and support, what could you pity more? Could any burden, any horror be worse than life itself? What good would Nature’s privilege to us be of having faces lifted up to contemplate the heavens, to ponder the gods’ majesty? Or the immortal gods giving us rational minds to learn useful skills, distinguish good from bad, embrace justice, to refrain from evil? Or indeed, language itself, a concession no other creature enjoys, and which makes us naturally superior to every other animal under heaven? With human nature so battered and oppressed by miseries, these gifts could all seem pointless if human nature had no hope of elevating itself toward heaven or of putting such perfect blessings to use. 

\[52\] But we *do\! * Because just as we have vari ous antidotes to counteract snakes’ venom, and a strong work ethic to counteract gripping poverty, and self-respect to counteract base pleasures, so *Philosophy* is the immortal gods’ gift to us to counteract gnawing grief. No one can praise Philosophy as she deserves, but we must all at least thank her, and her alone, for our gifts of inner peace, self- control, im-pulse control, and our awesome strength and fortitude in the face of bitter experience. Without *your* beneficence, Philosophy, I never could’ve endured exile, checked my ambitions, or have the wisdom and strength now to hold up in my grief. For human affairs, you are the finest of guides.

You’re freed from your prob lems, spared the ones looming, and sheltered now, safe and secure. I can readily believe you found death pleasant, since you’re either remembering the good parts of life or appreciating the misery you evaded by dying. 

\[54\] And since I’m deciding *you*’re happy— can almost \(if I can say it\) *see* it— why should your death torment *me*? I’ll *rejoice* instead, and congratulate you like you’ve gotten your fondest wish. And unless you’re upset at leaving *me* behind— wracked with old age, the country polarized, eking out life— 

what could trou ble or pain you now? 

\[55\] But reason helps a bit with that, too. Your job now isn’t to worry about me, but to focus on how I’ll soon be enjoying those same blessings with you. You see, no misfortune is too hard to bear when you nurture realistic hopes of a good thing coming.

• Why flinch at death? Its steady drumbeat admon-ishes us to better ourselves. It stops us from engaging in activities that could earn us a reputation for intemperance or injustice. 

• Conversely, why crave material things and the junk the masses love? Once we have them, we become soft, weak, \[57\] and so overwhelmed by those seductions that we barely remember it’s all coming to an end someday. 

The grand master of phi los o phers, Plato, put it wisely:

Even “resorting” to eternity is impossible, however, without death as our doorman and guide\! 

\[58\] What’s my point? It’s this: death isn’t just painless, peaceful, timely, and in short, a blessing. 

It’s also the generous and beneficial *agent* of supreme and eternal blessings. 

PREMATURE DEATH IS BEST

This explains why Cato \[ *the Younger*\] left this world suggesting he was excited to have gotten a reason to die. Now, it’s obvious that if a man as wise and disciplined as Cato congratulated himself on his death, he also recognized that death is the greatest good, \[59\] because no one misjudges their own interests, especially tangible interests. 

I can prove it by a statement of Artabanus, uncle of Xerxes and a man of great wisdom. According to Herodotus \[ *Histories* 7.46\], when Xerxes sur-veyed his army’s nearly infinite troops arrayed before him, he wept at the thought that of so many soldiers, in a hundred years not one would be alive. 

Artabanus replied, 

“Yes, but life’s sufferings are so many and so in-tense that there isn’t one who hasn’t repeatedly *wished* to die, any time horrible accidents or illness make life so taxing and stressful that it 57

Amphiaraum fabulae narrant Iovi atque Apollini fuisse carissimum, neque tamen illum senium attigisse. \[61\] Ex quo, ¿quid aliud coniici potest quàm mortis celeritatem divinum munus et lucrum esse maximum? Itaque, scitum est illud comicum—

♫ *Nam quem tuetur atque diligit deus,* *iuvenis supremum mortis intrat limitem*.♫

— neminem enim quem dilexerint di patiuntur esse miserum. Quare, vitam eis miseriarum plenam adimant necesse est.

seems too long. \[60\] Hence, death is undeniably a refuge from an unbearable life.” 

And not stopping there, he added, 

“The life of man is so horrible that when the immortal gods dressed it up in the trappings of happiness, they did so a bit grudgingly, to keep us from tasting the full sweetness of death.” 

My thol ogy tells us Jupiter and Apollo loved Amphiaraus dearly— and yet he did not reach old age. \[61\] 

The inescapable conclusion, therefore, is that a *speedy* death is a gift of the gods and an enormous blessing. 

That quotation from comedy gets it exactly:

♫ *The man God loves and lovingly protects,* *steps through death’s final portal in his teens*.♫

That’s because the gods don’t let anyone they love be miserable, and so they *have* to take a life filled with miseries away from them.

Miltiades, Ephialtes, Cimon, Themistocles, and Aristides, Greece’s greatest administrators—or rather, statesmen: where did *they* end up?

Among us Romans, Scipio Aemilianus \[ *Consul* *147 and 134 BCE*\] embraced the best cause, fought the outrageous greed of the few, and was found dead in bed one morning— with some even suspecting that his wife, a sister of the Gracchi brothers, had let the killers in. 

\[64\] Metellus Numidicus \[ *Consul 109 BCE*\] was a truly outstanding man, and what could be worse than *his* fate? To avoid swearing allegiance to a pernicious law, he was forced into exile. I grant that of all pos si ble kinds of exile and causes of misery, Metellus’s was the most honorable, in that his goodness, integrity, and patriotism were the cause of his suffering. That said, being ordered out of your homeland, torn from your loved ones, seeing your property confiscated, and watching the sobbing and suffering of your children: * those* were undeniably horrors beyond imagining.

These downfalls keep happening, I know, and they’re heartbreaking. Even more heartbreaking, though, is the man who aspires to leadership while being entirely dependent on the votes of the people. His situation is uniquely tragic. It’s rife with dread, doubt, striving, with anxiety. For him, we can be sure, not an hour passes without worry. I mean, if a slave is cursed with trying to determine his fate based on the character, whim, and temperament of his master, can the man who serves a greedy, jealous, ignorant, fickle, and above all *ungrateful* people ever be happy? If he reflects on the *nature* of the masses, can he really lament his misfortune and misery? 

The bard of old was right:

♫ *Once, long ago, the father of gods and king of* *all humans*

*ordered that mortals’ life be blended with heartaches unending. * 16♫

ON SUICIDE, MUTUAL DESTRUCTION, AND HOPE

On the contrary, I know many have committed suicide to avoid bigger prob lems than we face in normal everyday life. \(I say that *not* because I think suicide is a good idea, but to illustrate the endless pressures squeezing human life.17\)

\[67\] King Cleomenes \[ *III*\] of Sparta and his son took their own lives. So did Theagenes of Numan-tia; he killed his loved ones, and then himself, to avoid falling into enemy hands. I’d say they declared pretty unambiguously how critical it is to get away from life. And if men can decently cite examples of fortitude in females \(obviously much weaker\), let’s add from history the case of Hasdrubal’s wife. Seeing Carthage conquered and occupied by its enemy, she flung herself and her three children into the flames of her burning country. 

\[68\] But let’s leave these famous examples aside. 

Let’s just admit that human nature is so steeped in misery that neither the race as a whole nor individual members can be free of it. Moreover, our prob-lems aren’t even limited to those that constantly plague human nature. What’s so incredible is that we do every thing in our power to try to make ourselves *more* miserable every day.

Nullum enim aliud in toto terrarum orbe genus animantium reperias praeter unum hominem, quod in proprium genus atque in se ipsum saevitiam exerceat suam, meritòque Dicaearchus in eo libro, quem “De Hominis Interitu” luculentum et eruditum conscripsit, nihil <se> habere dubitationis putavit quin multo plures exstincti sint homines ipsā hominum saevitiā et acerbitate quàm omni reliquo genere calamitatis. Tanta est enim in permultis avaritia, tantum ambitionis, imperii, divitiarum studium ut explendae cupiditatis gratiā nihil sibi non licere putent. Atque hoc malum non iam angustis finibus compressum videmus, sed superioribus saeculis erupisse vehementer et manasse latius. Non enim certum aliquem hominum numerum, sed regna ipsa et totas persaepe funditus sustulit civitates.

Caduca enim et incerta sunt omnia, non in humanis consiliis aut viribus posita, sed in fortunae temeritate ac temporum vicissitudine constituta.

HOW TO GRIEVE

You see, in all the world one cannot find a single species— apart from man alone— that engages in cruelty towards its own kind, even itself. Dicaearchus was right to be adamant, in his wonderfully informative book *On the Ruin of Man*, that many more human lives have been lost to human cruelty and savagery than to any other kind of disaster. You see, in most men the greed, the *drive* for ambition, power, and wealth is so great that they consider nothing off- limits in satisfying their lust. What’s more, we’ve seen this scourge is no longer locally contained. In recent centuries it’s erupted violently, the flow spread far and wide, and obliterated not just thousands of people, but, often enough, entire kingdoms and socie ties. 

\[69\] But if you focus in on individuals, which are our primary concern, even there you won’t find anything genuinely attractive or admirable. I mean, imagine every factor in life that’s commonly regarded as a blessing or advantage: wealth, health, status, power, even pleasures. Give a man all this, and you *still* won’t be giving him anything stable or solid, not a thing that isn’t always susceptible to sudden change. Every thing is fleeting and uncertain. The world heeds *not* the plans or strength of man, but the fickleness of Fortune and changing of the seasons.

\[70\] Picture the utter disgrace of man, dependent on the vicissitudes of time and Fortune: uplifted by tailwinds, battered and defeated by headwinds, tri-umphant in success, whining and weepy at failure. 

In what way would man differ from the brute beasts from whom Nature withheld reason if, like them, we depended entirely on externals? If we had within us no fortitude, no grit, no stamina? 

You see, I know that man inherited from Mother Nature \(or *Step* mother, really\) a weak, brittle body, and a heart prone to stress, to sink in fear, and loathe to strug gle. Yet she also seeded us with innumerable divine flashes of creativity and critical thinking. She wanted to help us grapple with pain, face down fear, and to endure and overcome every ordeal effort-lessly. It’s incumbent on us, therefore, *not* to extinguish the fire of Divine Intelligence and discipline granted to us, but rather, when dormant, to rekindle and fan the flames.

• If the soul dies completely, then once consciousness is extinguished, nothing bad exists, and hence there’s no legitimate occasion for suffering. 

• If the soul *does* survive and thrive out of its bodily prison, what could be more blessed or heavenly than the dawning of a life that brings the *truest* occasion for happiness and joy? 

\[72\] Accordingly, nothing prevents us any longer from affirming that death really *is* the greatest good; that far from grieving when it comes, we must never run, and sometimes even opt for it; and all the more so, the longer you live. By then, you’ll have had enough of all the good that life can bring, and by freeing yourself of human prob lems, you’ll move on to a life of perfect bliss. 

You see, I am not one to think the soul dies with the person and that this great light of intelligence, sampled from God’s nature, *can* be extinguished. *I* believe that after a certain time, it returns to immortality.

♫ You *“tough” guys are displaying the mindset* *and heart of a woman. *

Because, of course, we *have* seen many examples of women that have shown a singular presence of mind and greatness of soul amid their private grief. 

But as with lust, *masculine* mental toughness ought to *rule* over pain, precisely as master does slave. It should constrain and crush pain, like a flawed and weak part of the soul, which, if allowed an outlet, will not only forestall reason, but even run rampant in the soul in triumph. I can’t even imagine anything more disgraceful or pernicious for a man.

He weighed the downsides that living entailed and was happy that dying meant a blissful end to all the misery. *That* is the proper response for a man who’s no prisoner of his appetites, isn’t hooked on plea sure, who ignores every craving; and *that*, in turn, is the sum and substance of reason and wisdom: taking charge of human nature, not giving in to pain, not growing anguished with longing, and, in sum, dreading no part of the human condition. 

\[75\] *Should* we despair at the death of children or relatives? Why? To act like fools— unable to endure what we cannot change, and getting overwhelmed despite ourselves? Just *ignore* all those magnificent pre-ce dents and testimonies we have from wiser heads that echo through the ages\!? How’s that dif fer ent from walking with your eyes closed? Or from preferring, when you could be out enjoying life with friends, to sit alone in the dark? I ask because antiquity has come up with *positive* role models for us to follow, and it’s with them that I’ll now deal in my essay.

Hence we hear that, far from becoming grief- stricken or in any way upset at the death of loved ones, the wisest among us often rejoiced. \[77\] Tradition has it that news of his son’s death reached Anaxagoras while he was lecturing among friends on the nature of the universe, and his only response was, 

“I knew he was mortal when I begot him.” 

A brilliant remark, truly worthy of such a great man\! I really don’t see what one could say to express greater wisdom or strength of mind. Should he have said:— ?

Far from the sudden news fazing or distracting him from his lecture, he spoke words that revealed con-summate fortitude and wisdom. 

I wish I could say the same for most of us\! When many people are involved in some minor accident, you’d think they’re crushed, devastated—as if what’s happened were totally unpre ce dented or weren’t bound to happen to them sooner or later\! Just when they *should* be at their toughest, they go so far as to forget, not only the resilience that they and their forefathers showed in the past, but even the laws of human nature and almost their very selves.

If you believe you’re completely powerless and attribute every thing to structural causes and the randomness of luck? I for one wouldn’t call that just slavery, but virtually imprisonment, and of the worst pos si ble kind. 

I mean, what’s the difference between getting ar-rested and locked up and guarded by enemies in jail, and getting caught up in grief and having no will of your own? Well, 

• In the first scenario, even if your body’s enslaved, at least your heart is still free, and you don’t doubt that freedom is coming. 

• As a slave of *grief*, though, you’re physically impaired *and* suffering unimaginable heartache. 

You can’t enjoy friends, serve your country, manage your private life, advise the public. You have freedom, but the most oppressive kind: you answer to no one, yet don’t govern yourself. 

Crushed by extreme and unrelenting anxiety, you’ll be miserable for however long your grief lasts.

OTHER INSPIRATIONAL EXAMPLES OF 

FORTITUDE IN GRIEF

\[80\] Xenophon was so much wiser\! While performing a sacrifice, he received word that his older son had fallen in battle at Mantinea. He removed the garland from his head, but he manfully continued performing the sacrifice. When he then heard he’d fallen fighting *bravely*, though, Xenophon put the garland back on, and called the gods he was pray-ing to as witness that his son’s *death* brought him less pain than his *heroism* did joy. 

I’d readily believe that *nothing* that can happen in life would have troubled that man. I mean, a man *so* resolute and unwavering in his worship of the gods that not even news of his son’s death could distract him— how could I think he’d argue with the will of the gods by mourning his son’s death? Can’t we conclude that if a man preferred his son’s heroism to his life, that when fired with valor and impelled by patriotism, he’d have eagerly endured any hardship, any tragedy?

HOW TO GRIEVE

manfully, *nothing* is more ennobling than a disregard for human needs. People who worry too much about them have no choice; they must suppress all thought of competitiveness, duty, or *anything* high- minded. 

You see, if you’re wholeheartedly obsessed with human concerns, you *cannot* think of saving or helping your country, winning praise for amazing achievements, or taking on and executing a major proj ect. 

You’ll ignore every thing else if you’re looking out for your *own* advantages, your *own* wallet. You’ll be thinking night and day of yourself. You’ll be neither patriot nor a real man, since a real man serves the interests of others as much as his own, while a patriot puts his own interests second and prioritizes those of his country— and from those interests, no grief or human trou bles should ever distract us. 

\[82\] Pericles, says history, lost two sons— 

extraordinary young men—in four days. He was so strong and unwavering in his grief, though, that he didn’t change a single thing in his conduct or appearance. On the contrary, he kept to his schedule of public meetings and never removed the garland from his head. We’re told he thought nothing would be more compromising than to reveal, as women do, any sign of grief or anguish. 

What a hero, worthy of all our praise and everlasting memory\! The power of nature could not 87

HOW TO GRIEVE

destabilize *him*, not make *him* grief- stricken, though it often makes us too attached. And the longing for his children— though we’re told he loved them deeply— also failed to shake him in any way. 

\[83\] And that’s not surprising, since true fortitude repels and banishes pointless anx i eties. It quashes desires, controls dread, wants nothing unworthy of a real man, is deterred from nothing by fear or wavering.19 And although clear thinking, combined with education, can *strengthen* a natu ral predisposition to greatness— which was the case, I’m convinced beyond all doubt, with Pericles, a man endowed with extraordinary learning *and* genius— nevertheless, fortitude itself is first and foremost rooted in the *heart*. When your heart despises human concerns and refuses to be abased or dragged down, it easily comes to bear healthier and more abundant fruits. It does so because you’ve applied clear thought and education to it, the same way cultivation improves an excellent piece of land. 

We must not imagine that our heroes *felt* no grief at all; I mean, what sort of fortitude could reside in a heart that feels nothing or lacks all sensation? 

Rather, it was *while feeling grief* that they made a heroic mental effort to conquer and crush it, and they strug gled so valiantly that they walked away the victors.

HOW TO GRIEVE

\[84\] You see, it’s true what they say, that *no* *greater bane can befall the heart than a moment’s* *letting up*. 

• When the mind remains taut and braced for impact, it bears every burden, swats down even speeding bullets. 

• When it’s weakened and unmanned by letting up, by contrast, it becomes so distraught and depressed that it cannot regain its balance. 

You’d never be able to face and endure a bout of grief manfully if you hadn’t steeled yourself for impact in advance. You’d never be able to learn mental toughness if you hadn’t fought back pain many times in the past. \[85\] Those strug gles breed habituation, which toughens the heart and arms us against every blow of Nature or Fortune. 

Could Harpagus the Mede have furnished the striking example of fortitude recorded by Herodotus \[ *Histories 1*. *119–129*\] if he hadn’t repeatedly practiced endurance and mental toughness in advance? 

And didn’t it pay off in spades, and to his eternal credit? His ability to play the long game was *so* superior that he endured the bitterest outrage without any vis i ble sign of grief, and he succeeded in repay-ing the king’s sadism with interest.

“Agnosco \( *inquit*\) quid sit actum ac, quidquid regi placuit, mihi quoque placere pronuntio.” 

Hoc autem immanissimum genus iniuriae tam diu dissimulavit, quoad Cyrum ex Persiā in Mediam evocare potuit; quo adveniente— quum exercitūs imperator contra eum a rege missus esset—et regnum et regem illi tradidit. 

Itaque, Astyages in Cyri potestatem, impietatis suae poenas daturus, redactus est.

Nam adversùs iniustitiam atque impietatem tantum est odium, tanta invidia ut ne ipsum quidem caelum aut sidera, etiam si homines velint, huius modi scelera pati ac dissimulare possint. Ac, si sera deorum vindicta sit, noluerunt tamen impios ipso in facinore adeo exsultare ut non angore conscientiae fraudisque cruciatu tamquam domesticis Furiis adsidue 92 

HOW TO GRIEVE

You see, the king, Astyages, had ordered Harpagus’ son killed and served for dinner. After the meal, the king had the head brought in and shown to Harpagus, and asked, “What kind of meat do you think you were eating?” Harpagus didn’t panic, didn’t flinch. He simply said, 

“I see what’s been done, and let it be known that all that pleases the king, pleases me as well.” 

He then hid his horror at this outrage until such time as he could call Cyrus \[ *the Great*\] of Persia in to Media. And when Cyrus drew near— since Harpagus had been dispatched to lead the army against him—he handed Cyrus both kingdom and king. So it is that Astyages was made prisoner to Cyrus to pay for his sin. 

\[86\] Now * there*’s a lesson for all mankind, for the ages\! Let it inspire those wallowing in grief to get tough and endure. Let it also be a warning to kings and authorities not to abuse their power wantonly— 

because outrageous abuses are so hated, *so* resented, that even if humans remained silent in the face of such crimes, the very sky and stars above could not. The gods may delay vengeance, true, but they refused to let abusers celebrate getting away with their crimes; abusers feel pangs of guilt and re-morse, like demons inside, constantly harassing 93

If clear thinking is the way to *stifle* grief, as I’ve said \[ *section 83*\], then *habituation* will actually help *overcome* it. The force of habit is such that it not only calms emotions, it can even hack Nature, and often even change her entirely. Habit will help us brush off not only acute pain but even freak accidents, and laugh at them. 

SUMMARY, RECAPITULATION, AND 

FURTHER EXAMPLES

Let’s therefore reflect and agree, once and for all, that absolutely no human tragedy should afflict us:

• Not death, which we now know is the greatest good \[ *sections 58, 72, 76*\]. 

• Not poverty, which the immortal gods often bestow as a great blessing. 

• Not exile, since all the world is our homeland. 

• Not anything else of the sort the masses call their worst nightmares. 

You see, nothing will happen so dire that— thanks to the gods’ great kindness—it doesn’t ultimately 95

Why wallow in grief ever again? 

For example, Dion \[ *tyrant of Syracuse, 408–354 *

\[89\] That said, Prexaspes showed far *greater* fortitude. *He* was made to watch his son die— shot in the chest— and remained emotionless; Cambyses 

\[ *II, King of Persia*\] was drunk and had been angrily taking shots at his son. Cambyses then had the boy’s chest slit open and told the father to check and see if he’d reached the heart. “Yes,” the father answered. “The arrow is sticking out of his heart.” 

“Do I, or do I not, have a sure hand?” Cambyses asked. Showing no sign of grief or distress and never dropping his gaze, the father replied, 

“Even *Apollo* couldn’t have shot straighter, I don’t think.”

extent I can, I also aim to offer *comprehensive* consolation for every one’s grief. 

Hence, I’m finding that listing these examples greatly reduces and alleviates my pain. I want the same for others, and even dare hope it will. I mean, with this almost dizzying array of arguments and case studies, could *anyone* suffering from grief that’s reading these pages remain unmoved— remain beyond help? 

\[ *Gap in the text here*\]

\[92\] . . . that said, I realize accidents do sometimes happen which leave the heart so overwhelmed and flustered that it resists treatment; and if there’s ever a case where that happens, it tends to occur most when we’re stricken with grief. Why? Because thinking of a lost friend or relative or child makes us *so* happy— 

because it feels like the person is practically standing before our eyes— that even though thinking of them rips the pain back open and makes us cry, we still don’t want to stop. Worse, even if therapies are available to console us, there’s still nothing we’d rather hear less than voices of consolation. Those who react this way are sorely mistaken, of course, but the mistake makes them so happy they won’t give it up.

\[93\] So, let’s let each person keep what works for them, each their illusion. I mean, if people say not to use remedies in the very throes of grief \[ *in section 1*\], well, once the grief has partially subsided and started letting up a bit, I’m certainly not worried about them using my strategies and rules to stamp out what grief remains. 

THE BENEFITS OF PRACTICE

Moreover, there’s nothing more useful than studying and keeping these strategies near in times of joy and happiness. That way, people can read and review and memorize them, because once they internalize them, they can’t easily lose or forget them. 

\[94\] That way, too, if grief attacks suddenly, we’ll apply them reflexively. And that’s good, because if we haven’t taken them in and understood them in advance, the violent incursion of grief itself tends to totally forestall and block them out. 

That was my own experience, and, without question, not internalizing this whole “anti- grief” science far in advance did hurt me. You see, I’d read a great many philosophy books titled *Grief* or *On* *Death*, such as those by Theophrastus, Xenocrates, and others there’s no point naming, and relatively carefully. However, I didn’t read them in the thought that I might one day use them for my own 103

And yet it’s true that time *did* later make the pain less acute, and my mind a little calmer and in a better state to accept treatment. 

\[95\] But let’s keep going. There aren’t many more examples and they’re absolutely worth our atten-tion, while the results— which are what we’re really after— may well enrich and enhance the reading. 

GRIEF IS ILLOGICAL

What could shake our conviction that the death of loved ones just isn’t a cause for grief? The idea, possibly, that we’d have garnered some great benefit from the support of those we’ve lost? But that thought would pertain to *ourselves*, not the friends or relatives whose passing we think we’re grieving. 

In that case, grief would be up for rent. It would result not from family ties or love, but self- interest. 

Now, imagine the grief- stricken man who’s shattered by someone’s death because he feels he’s lost out on some self- interest. Could anything be more pathetic or disgraceful than him admitting that if he * hadn’t* hoped to get some advantage from the 105

ANCIENT EXAMPLES OF ROMAN FORTITUDE

They survived those losses with such stamina and fortitude that there’s no reason *not* to compare, even prefer, them to the Greeks mentioned above. Indeed, on one score they’re far ahead: namely, those whose deaths summoned forth such displays of stamina and fortitude not only would have been a great help to their parents if they’d lived, they were virtually their parents’ *only* source of help and delight. Because what’s more helpful than a child, or more delightful than an *only* child? 

\[ *1*\] \[97\] Quintus Fabius \[ *Maximus Verrucosus,* *Consul, third century BCE*\] lost a son— his only son, and a former Consul to boot— who’d accomplished great things and was planning greater.

Still, it seems wrong to pass over that towering man in silence. He too endured the death of a son, and with such fortitude and composure that he evidently impressed Jupiter Optimus Maximus himself.

Not only did Pulvillus *not* with-draw his hand \(so as not to invalidate the ritual\); he didn’t even avert his gaze from the people, for fear of seeming to care more for his own grief than the general welfare of the people.

devotion and promise—he overpowered grief with discipline. The very day he watched his son be cremated, he walked into the Curia and called the Senate to order. 

\[ *7*\] \[ *Marcus Licinius*\] Crassus \[ *Consul in 70 and* *56 BCE*\] saw his son killed in the battle he fought against the Parthians. He was so far from grieving, however, that he shouted at the army for getting so upset at losing a single soldier. “Remember your ancestors’ valor, and fight bravely for our country\!” 

he urged them. “And leave the job of avenging my son to me.” 

\[ *8*\] \[102\] A more ancient Publius Crassus was a senator and sometime Consul \[ *see Letters to* * Atticus 12.24*\]. He too witnessed his son, Publius Crassus, die, and took it in great stride. 

\[ *9*\] Equally impressive— and possibly surpassing Crassus— was Gnaeus \[ *Servilius*\] Caepio \[ *Consul* *55 BCE*\]. Having lost his son, Caepio, in a ship-wreck, he was so far from grieving that not a single friend could tell from his face or body that he was even marginally affected. 

\[ *10–16*\] Why list all the Pisos, the Scaevolas, Brutuses, Marcelluses, Metelluses, Lepiduses, the Au-fidiuses? After losing many children or wives or parents, each thought grieving inappropriate. They believed a display of manful courage at those funerals 113

ON MANFULNESS IN WOMEN

\[103\] It’s embarrassing to go on rehearsing men’s tragedies, because manfulness is literally a trait of men; it’s mainly found and thrives in men. I ought to speak of * women* instead. Once we see that they’ve displayed incredible fortitude too, men will be embarrassed to have females as their examples of manfulness— and to realize that women have sometimes outdone them in the one strength that’s sup-posed to be their own domain. \[104\] I mean, if it’s true \(as I believe Theophrastus states somewhere\) that:

“The cosmos is an im mense ‘theater’ filled with Divine Intelligence and spangled and frescoed with starlight to convey the celestial wisdom. In the center, God set humans, in order to grapple constantly with misfortune, pain, sickness, poverty, and endless tragedies. Moreover, God himself is watching from above to see how each of us is sustaining the strug gle and how manfully we’re using the fortitude God has given us.”20

If that’s true, I say, then the implication is beyond doubt:

\[105\] Quod si feminas praestitisse intellegimus, ¿cur iis imbecilliores atque infirmiores videri velint viri? Neque solum unam aliquam e multis feminam, sed totam gentem ac nationem ut marium virtute sic feminarum eximiā

\[106\] Lacaenas enim matronas traditum est occisis filiis vulnera inspicere consuevisse, ac, si adversos vulneratos esse comperissent, laetabundas funus ducere eosque in avita sepulcra inferre solitas esse; contra verò, quos aversis vulneribus concisos agnoscebant, ab iis refugientes clam sepeliendos curabant nec ullo prorsus honore 116 

HOW TO GRIEVE

• As Roman audiences jeer a gladiator in the arena who’s too quick to beg and plead for life, and cheer for one that displays open contempt for it, 

• So the immortal gods, if they see people frantic about life ending and refusing to leave, get in some way indignant at them. On the other hand, they cherish and bless those who, finding themselves or their loved ones being recalled from life, obey God cheerfully and happily, and don’t decide that something bad is happening to them because of it. 

\[105\] Moreover, if we learn that * women* have shown heroism, why would *men* be okay with looking more emotional and weak- minded than them? And it’s not just a single woman we’re talking about, but an entire *nation* whose women are as renowned for greatness of soul as the men are for prowess. 

**Examples of Women in Sparta**

\[106\] You see, we’re told that in Sparta, when sons were killed in battle, their mothers would check the wounds. If they found the wounds in front, they’d lead the funeral pro cessions joyfully and bury their children in the tombs of their ancestors. Conversely, if they found they’d been wounded from behind, they would turn away, have them buried in secret, and forbid that they be given any funeral ser vice at 117

At alia, filium in proelio interfectum audiens, 

“Idcirco \( *inquit*\) genueram ut mortem pro patriā 

fortiter occumbere non dubitaret.” 

\[108\] ¿Quid his feminis facias, aut quo non honore ac gratulatione dignas putes quae de patriae dignitate deque gloriā sollicitae honestam mortem cuivis saluti ac lucro anteponerent?

all. *That’s* how power ful a sense of honor and glory is, even in the hearts of women. 

\[107\] Sparta also yields us this next inspiring report of a mother examining her son. He’d been fatally stabbed six times, but she refused to groan or remove the garland from her head. Instead, she turned to those around her and said, 

“It is far more glorious and desirable to win on the battlefield, and expire, than to win in the Olympics and live\!” 

Another, hearing her son had been killed in combat, said, 

“*This* is what I brought him into the world for: to meet death bravely, without hesitation, for his country.” 

\[108\] What can we say? These women were concerned for the dignity and glory of their country, so they preferred an honorable death to a life of comfort at any cost. What honor or congratulations do they *not* deserve? 

**Examples of Women in Rome**

And come *on*: are *Roman* women *less* courageous than Spartans? Equal, maybe—or maybe even more.

HOW TO GRIEVE

\[ *1*\] Consider that brave and glorious remark of Cornelia’s. She’d already lost twelve children when she saw her sons Tiberius and Gaius assassinated. 

Instead of getting para lyzed by fear or traumatized by grief, she said, 

“I would never call myself unhappy: *I* bore the Gracchi\!” 

What a *heroic* woman\! Her fortitude and greatness of soul equal any of the ancients\! *She* did not wallow in grief, no; she *conquered* grief, manfully, and then *celebrated* her conquest in triumph. 

\[ *2*\] \[109\] So, let’s no longer be surprised at Rutilia, who went with her son Gaius Cotta into exile and lost him once back. Nobody saw her shed a tear after the burial. 

\[ *3*\] It was the same with Clodia. She survived the death of her son Decimus Brutus— a former Consul \[ *in 77 BCE*\]— yet endured his passing courageously and without complaint. 

These extraordinary examples of manfulness in women might surprise you if you focus on the weakness and emotionality of the female sex. Remembering, though, that these women were scions of parents, grandparents, and ancestors of the greatest fortitude, you’d expect no less discipline or greatness of soul from them.

IN SUMMARY: MAINTAIN ROMAN DISCIPLINE

\[110\] So: is any object so precious, or any privilege so enviable, that losing it should make us lose our heads, too? 

If insight hasn’t given up on us just yet, it surely reminds us of the greatness of our progenitors. It won’t let us forget the Pisos, Fabiuses, Brutuses, the Marcelluses we descend from and should live up to. 

\[111\] You see, *their* armies extended our empire’s borders, of *their* blood our freedom was born and strengthened, *their* toil and commitment elevated our country to its current peak of glory in both war and civilian life. If you want to live respected, live a life of honor, and avoid mistakes that lead to enormous grief and a ner vous breakdown, *theirs* are the footsteps you should follow in. 

A CODA FROM ATHENS

I’ve cited the cases of great and famous foreign men, and I’ve collected a good many Romans who found dying not only *not* unpleasant, but even desirable and welcome. Let’s add Theramenes \[ *of Athens, executed by order of Critias*\], if you like. He chugged the poison, and fading away, deadpanned, 

“Critias darling, *cheers\! * I toast these last drops to you.”21

Quamvis enim nudum corpus et exanime discedens relinquat animus, nec amplius liceat homini qui e vitā discedat suis opibus, bonis, divitiis perfrui—

♫ . . . *astante* \(ut ille ait\) *ope barbaricā*, *tectis caelatis, laqueatis* . . . ♫

\[113\] Sed dimittamus et exempla clarorum hominum et illorum virtutis impressam historiis memoriam; veniamus ad id quod unusquisque sensu percipit, quantumque ex morte consequamur emolumenti ac commodi re ipsā factisque probemus.

HOW TO GRIEVE

\[112\] If that wise statesman joked about his *own* death, will we cry at the deaths of children or relatives? As we go along reading and memorizing the words of the ancients each day, will we admire their wisdom but not follow their lead? Just forget the eternal, happy, blissful life to come after our death? 

I know the soul’s departure leaves the body naked and lifeless. I know a dying man can no longer enjoy his wealth, his riches, his money—

♫ * . . . surrounded by outlandish wealth,* *gold- coffered ceilings, gorgeous plasterwork . . . *♫

—as the poet says. Yet by dying, good souls come into eternally *greater* riches— riches that no passage of time can ever diminish, nor any vio lence steal away. 

\[113\] But let’s forget about examples of famous individuals and the heroic rec ord of greatness they stamped on history. Let’s get down to things we *all* go through and use facts and real- world experience to try to quantify the benefits we reap from death. 

That approach to teaching and discussion best illumi-nates the truth and lets us see things as they really are.

Timely Death Spares Us Grief

\[114\] If a person could theoretically succeed at every-thing all life long and never have to worry, they’d undeniably be right to say that in many re spects, life is better than death. But so far from quarantining heartache and misery off from human life, there’s not a person in the world who could guarantee him- or herself even half an hour of pure happiness\! 

\[115\] Every one dreams of getting Metellus’s life, while some fantasize about Priam’s progeny and kingdom. Pfft\! 

• As if Metellus \[ *Macedonicus, Consul in 143 BCE*\] 

* didn’t* go unwillingly, although seeing all his many children and grandchildren could have brought him to the peak of happiness, and

• As if Priam \[ *legendary King of Troy*\] * didn’t* end up bereft of all his children, para lyzed by extreme grief, and killed by an invading army\! 

Had death claimed their lives a few years sooner, it would’ve spared them a great deal of misery and grief. Instead, they suffered precisely * because* they prolonged life longer than happiness required.

It’s stomach- churning just to *hear* that, much less *watch* it; can you imagine the poor king that had to watch and hear and *live* it? Wouldn’t a far better fate have been to simply lose his life years before that all happened? “By dying sooner, he’d have forever lost out on many blessings he enjoyed in life.” 

I guess you could say that, yes, but he’d also have been mercifully spared the far greater horrors that many centuries haven’t seen. 

\[117\] These and many other examples prove that human beings skew the fundamentals of human happiness when they divorce expediency from death or link death to misery. 

THE LUCK OF CRASSUS

\[118\] Think of the heartache and headaches a timely death spared Lucius \[ *Licinius*\] Crassus \[ *Consul in* *95 BCE*\], the finest orator in our country\!

because we remember, or at least read in our fathers’ 

books, that an indiscriminate bloodbath was perpe-trated in that period. Good, patriotic heroes were massacred, and those whose eloquence had *created* the welfare and dignity of many citizens found themselves decapitated, their heads hung up for display in the Forum.22 I can recall *so* many from that stormy period in our country’s history— perfectly innocent, outstanding people— who sought freedom in death to escape that hideous nightmare\!

THE MISFORTUNE OF POMPEY THE GREAT

But those events all happened a little too long ago for every one to remember and internalize them. 

\[123\] Pompey, though, my friend . . . nothing in Roman history is more famous, no object lesson more striking or blindingly obvious, than his downfall \[ *in 48 BCE*\]. A timely death would’ve shielded him from all heartache, all evil; staying *alive* so long is what made him into a tragic figure like no other. 

And in light of the happier and more prosperous fortune he’d met with all his life, he found Fortune’s bitter irony all the more grievous. No one’s ever been more universally loved, never was anyone more distinguished in politics for special appointments or achievements, never more blessed with wealth, friendships, influence. His supreme and perfect happiness lacked for absolutely nothing— 

except an honorable and pleasant end of life. 

\[124\] But *behold* the havoc Fortune can wreak in human affairs\! \( Unless, that is, we’d rather blame *all* our ills on the grueling condition of mortal life.\) You see, the same Pompey that commanded the greatest fortunes, that contemplated or aspired to nothing but the sublime and edifying, that had every thing you could ever need or want: *that* man 133

And, though in every other war he’d only taken action after careful planning and calculation, at the very moment he *should* have distinguished himself by his *greatest* strategic genius, he all but forgot himself. \[125\] He unthinkingly sent weak and untrained “troops”— raw, random recruits— into combat against battle- hardened infan-trymen, and then— his army lost, camp plundered, himself defeated in disgrace— the great hero fell into the hands of . . . slaves. 

There’s no need to repeat the tragedy of his murder, since on that score— that after plummeting so low, he lost his life quickly—he could arguably be accounted *less* miserable. Either way, he would’ve died supremely happy if he’d departed life as the po liti cal darling he once was, at the height of his authority and influence, commanding soldiers and resources. It’s impossible to describe or even *imagine* how much heartache and grief prolonging his life brought him. 

IN SUM: WE SHOULD WELCOME DEATH

\[126\] We’ve now determined that in numerous cases, death turns out happy. Not only does it usher us into a happy life, it also frees us from our endless stresses and rescues us from heartaches and 135

• Didn’t Lucius Brutus decide death was happy and the greatest good when, in seeking to keep the tyrant he’d overthrown out of Rome \[ *in 509 *

*BCE*\], he regarded his life as nothing? 

• Ditto the Deciuses. Didn’t they sacrifice themselves to the speartips of the enemy Latins \[ *340,* *295 BCE*\] for their country? 

• Likewise Scipio \[ *212*\], Paullus \[ *216*\], Marcellus 

\[ *208*\], and Albinus \[ *215*\]? History tells us all of them laid down their lives to aid their country in battle. 

In fact, there was no reason for those lofty, towering souls *not* to scorn life in order to win eternal glory, since they were trading the non- existent, or surely not much more, feeling of pain that the dying experience for infinite praise.

Death Is Painless or Nearly So

SLEEP IS A PICTURE OF DEATH

You see, I think the man was on to something who claimed we can gain par tic u lar insight into the state and condition of the dead and dying from two situations, one being sleep, the other the time before our birth. \[128\] And of all the ideas that most mis-lead the masses when they speak of death, this one surely seems the most probable, because most people live in the moment and really don’t think about the good or bad that can happen to them or others a few years from now. The result is that when trauma, emotions, and depression hit unexpectedly, they often get overwhelmed. Meanwhile, they don’t even spare a thought for death— which they should have planned for most— since they assume it’s totally irrelevant and uninteresting. \[129\] They’re like aggressive horses, which, Panaetius says Scipio Africanus used to say, should be handed over to train-ers to gradually learn obedience and compliance. 

In the same way, these people themselves need to be put into a training ring of fortitude and endurance; that way, if death catches them unsuspectingly, they won’t panic and fall apart. 

\[130\] Addiction to plea sure has somehow seduced and warped people’s be hav ior from the upright 139

Atqui, si in ullo homine, certe in his ipsis vulgare dictum et verum et acute cogitatum esse deprehenditur. \[131\]

lives our ancestors led. It’s gradually reached a point where truth is what people know least, and in contemplating a course of action, they don’t consider its moral impact in earnest. And with humanity already seriously compromised, no virus more fatal or insidious than that could be introduced. 

If there’s any truth and accuracy to the popu lar saying \[ *“sleep is a picture of death” *\], surely there is with these people. \[131\] I mean, they waste whole entire days sitting around, “living” in such a way you’d think they’re snoring, not living in any meaningful sense:

• As the *sleeping* man perceives nothing, does nothing, and cares about nothing, 

• So what the *dead* man can or could do, care about, or perceive, is hard to tell. 

Accordingly, legends tell us the immortal gods put those they cherish most into a deep sleep to spare them some imminent disaster they’d have to witness if awake. 

\[132\] If death really *is* similar to sleep, therefore, we’ve been trying it on every night. And since there’s obviously no awareness in sleep, the likeli-est scenario, we should decide, is that there’ll be no awareness in death, either.

And as the senses themselves demonstrate this first claim clearly, so we cannot doubt that in the second case, 

• As we were before birth, 

• So we’ll be when dead. 

You see, just as death means nothing to the man who isn’t born yet, so it will mean nothing at all to the man who’s dead. Even for the * dying* man death means nothing or little, since it’s limited to such a short duration and such a narrow compass that it couldn’t extend or expand its force even if it tried. 

THE SIGNS ARE AMBIGUOUS

\[133\] What’s the point, then, of all the wailing from people that they’re so horribly afraid of death? 

Though, I don’t really see what choice they have. I mean, if you’ve never *experienced* death— and a human being will only undergo it once— how can you actually try it and decide whether it’s good or bad? 

“The dying,” they say, “get tortured, strangled, and pulled apart in agony.” Yes, it’s pos si ble we *have* seen signs of that in some cases. \[134\] And they’d possibly have a point on that score if the suffering were a function of the *feeling* of death. I mean, if death’s painfulness itself *did* so torture and strangle the body that it were *forced* to manifest 143

Atque in iis etiam praestans planeque admirandum deorum munus agnoscitur.

HOW TO GRIEVE

those signs of pain, then case closed: death is going to really hurt. But because throes like that afflict very few, and primarily those who’ve lived immod-erate, sinful, wicked lives, the real ity can only be that the cause of their anguish and distress isn’t death, but their guilty conscience. 

\[135\] You see, when death comes to people who never believed they’d die— never even gave it a thought— what torments them isn’t the pain of dying, but the fact that they’re being forced to leave. They have to assume and worry that, because every thing went so spectacularly in life, it’ll be dif fer ent in death. 

CASES OF SUDDEN DEATH SUGGEST 

PAINLESSNESS

\[136\] With people of *virtue*, it’s dif fer ent. To those who always spoke of death as a refuge from an unrelenting storm, and always craved the blessing of death to fi nally escape the fury of this life, nothing sounds sweeter or more delightful than the word *death*. Their experiences are an excellent illustration of how wonderful the gods’ gift is, since it’s easy to find a great many virtuous people who departed this world not only suffering very little— that’s what we all hope for— but without any suffering at all. Examples include \[137\]:

¿Quid hos in ipso mortis articulo doloris expertos existimes, qui paulo ante laeti vivebant, et in eo quo moriebantur puncto temporis, nihil lugubre testati sint, nihil flebile dixerint? “Morte,” inquies, “oppressi sunt.” \[138\] At sapientissimi et optimi viri, quibus mortem tamquam beatae vitae initium di immortales largiri voluerunt; quam eo fortasse iucundiorem ipsis fore videbant, quo minus eo tempore tantum boni exspectaverant ac ne sperare quidem poterant.

• Quintus Fabius \[ *Maximus*\], who’d recently become Consul \[ *45 BCE*\]. While shaking hands in the receiving line in the Senate building—

• \[ *Aulus*\] Pompeius \[ *Tribune, 102 BCE*\], while leading Mass in the Temple of Capitoline Jupiter, and

• \[ *Manius Juventius*\] Thalna, the Consul \[ *163 *

*BCE*\], while leading a public prayer of supplication. 

What pain can you imagine they felt at the very instant of death? They were alive and happy moments before, and in the seconds it took to die, they showed no sign of suffering or complaint. “Death zapped them,” you’ll say. \[138\] No, it’s * because* of their wisdom and greatness that the immortal gods chose to *reward* them with death, as an entrance to a happy life. The gods apparently figured that if those men had no reason to expect or hope for so great a blessing at that time, they’d find death all the more pleasant. Death depends entirely on the gods’ 

will, you see, so the exact date and circumstances of dying are not of man’s choosing.

Sed de his statuat unusquisque ut libet. Quid autem verius sit, deus ipse viderit; hominem quidem scire arbitror neminem.

Itaque, hoc divinitus hominibus datum 148 

HOW TO GRIEVE

HUMANS HAVE NO FIXED LIFE SPAN

\[139\] It’s also untrue, despite what some say, that the human species is programmed with the same divinely fixed expiration date, and that whether we die before or after it is determined by individuals’ 

healthy or unhealthy choices. You see, as sure as it is that God has foreordained a limit to life that none of us can exceed or escape, it’s equally certain that nobody could prove that the same type and hour of death await us all. \[140\] If we really thought it did, we’d have no reason to praise a person for maintaining discipline, making healthy choices, or being religious. From then on, all those virtues would seem not just useless, but utterly meaningless. 

I mean, why practice risk avoidance, discipline, or make healthy choices if life is going to expire on the same timeline as every one else? “To prolong life” you say. \[141\] But if life is term limited by fate, then, necessarily, you * can’t* change it; whereas if the end *is* a matter of choice and up to us, there’s no reason to claim God has fixed the same life span for us all. 

Well, let’s each decide that one for ourselves. God alone can figure the truer version out, since I don’t think any * human* knows. Let’s just agree that there’s no pain in death, and that actually, it’s the source of more good than many of us could hope or even imagine. It explains why humans have a God- given 149

Admonet me locus ut, quum neminem ipsā morte magno opere commoveri debere probatum sit, iis praecipue dolendum nihil esse contendam quos mors cum laude oppetita consolari potest. Satis enim diu vixisse putandi sunt, qui vitam honeste clauserunt. Eosdemque e vitā

habit of wishing for death every time they suffer a setback; they often even swear to God they want it. 

Why? Because they’re hit with the realization that death is good and expedient, and Nature has planted the instinct in humans that death can never be evil or hurtful. \[142\] Accordingly, in moments of despair we cry out for death, asking for it alone to terminate our suffering. 

A GLORIOUS DEATH MAKES GRIEF UNNECESSARY

On that note: Now that we’ve proven death per se shouldn’t really upset anyone, I should demonstrate that grief is especially unnecessary when you can take comfort in a *glorious* death. You see, a life must be considered sufficiently long when it’s concluded with honor; it goes out in triumph and finds everlasting bliss in its train. Moreover, the harder you’ve worked to fulfill your duties and live a life of honor, the greater that feeling grows and intensifies in your soul. \[143\] I mean, man was surely born to do good; that’s *why* we’re graced with an intellect superior to all other animals. Where else, then, should we seek greater glory or satisfaction than in honorable conduct? Should we *forget* our origins? 

Well, live a moral life and you’ll show you * didn’t* forget. You’ll also die without regret, since you’ll be leaving behind so many witnesses to your integrity.

You see, we surely have souls sampled from a Divine Intelligence. Trapped in our molecules, they’re held here by the oppressive weight of our bodies the same way gravity holds our bodies to earth. 

When they’re released and fly back home where they belong, though, *real* life begins. Emancipated from desire, plea sure, and pain, they’re autonomous at last: serene, in de pen dent, in absolute control. \[145\] 

I agree, therefore, that

“The body is earth, but the mind is fire from heaven.”23

The proof lies in the heroic lives and grand gestures of great men. I mean, how could they:

• Count every plea sure as nothing, or

• Sacrifice their very lives for honor and glory 153

But that isn’t what happens. You see, the *body* is formed of earth, and it’s forever spellbound by earthly things until it returns back into its mother earth. The *soul*, by contrast, is taken from heaven. 

It longs for something heavenly and eternal and doesn’t restrict its thoughts to the same limits as the body. Hence it has, we must assume, no rest or real life as long as it remains trapped in the body, imprisoned in earth’s shackles and mortal mire. 

\[146\] Imagine the *relief*, though, of finding *freedom* from life’s crippling toils, and *sleep* amidst suffering and pain\! It’s like getting released from a horrible prison— life— into a supremely happy and joyful home. *This* is what phi los o phers mean when they speak of the tranquility and joy we’re told the righ teous enjoy upon departing this world. They understood humans weren’t created or put here at random or without design. They understood that *good* people who suffer enormously and then die tragically don’t deserve the same fate as wicked people whose hearts and minds are forever fixated on committing crimes. Hence, they determined, the span of life is not the same for the good and the evil, and their rewards in death aren’t the same, either.

Remembering her, now that the pain is fading if not gone, doesn’t just get me choked up anymore; it makes me smile, too. How could I not? Nothing bad can happen to *her*, and I myself shouldn’t worry or get upset at anything so natu ral or universal a human experience. \[148\] So, now that, thanks to a special blessing of the gods, she’s acquitted herself of her duty to life, what’s next for me?

And *that* thought makes me smile all the more, since the state she’s enjoying now is unquestionably better than what she got in life. I mean, what happiness is she *not* entitled to? She never *contemplated*, much less did, anything bad.

but she was content to keep it to herself. She never thought to advertise her good works or expected any recognition for them. \[149\] With a heart bent entirely on justice and fairness and never on herself, then, * shouldn’t* I think she found the greatest favor with the immortal gods themselves? In her, we saw the embodiment of greatness— not a flimsy imitation, as in many, but rock- solid, defined, and radiant. 

You see, she was naturally predisposed to side with what she deemed noble and right, but she didn’t stop there. She’d analyze and assess situations so master-fully you’d think native wits were the one thing she needed least. \[150\] And if you’d examined her conduct and character in greater detail, or witnessed her skillful house hold management, deep knowledge, and knack for every thing, hardly anything would’ve needed a man’s wisdom or patriarch’s acumen to understand and settle matters. 

She was a woman, and yet fortitude and practicality—so rare even in us men— were so highly developed in her that she never sought outside help for her ordeals. Instead, she’d look to *herself* and rely on her own inner strength. 

Moreover, to the extent that emotional traumas are more serious and challenging than physical traumas, it’s all the more impressive that she overcame her *physical* prob lems with fortitude, while she conquered every *emotional* trauma with practicality.

Hence, even though she suffered enormously because of my own misfortunes \[ *in 58–57 BCE*\], I never saw her flustered or depressed. \[151\] She *was* distraught at her father’s exile; it hurt to see her whole family weeping and our property confiscated. But she was there for her mother, offer-ing advice and perspective, and every time we were on the verge of a breakdown, she was adamant that I’d return. So, for all the grief my disaster gave us, our daughter’s loving devotion equaled it in solace. 

In fact, if all I cared about were myself or a father’s instinctive love, I’d want that period to go on longer. 

Realizing, though, that she’s free of her body’s shackles, past all suffering, and in possession of immortality, my pain doesn’t just subside; it turns into great joy. \[152\] I mean, in reflecting on the immortality of souls, what could make me smile more than believing in my daughter’s life of eternal happiness? Because souls *are* immortal, I think, and I don’t think we can doubt it.

ARGUMENTS FOR THE IMMORTALITY 

OF THE SOUL

Since this essay’s led me to the point, I’ll gladly review the greatest thinkers’ thoughts on the immortality of the soul \[ *cf. section 4*\]. 

**A Bad Argument: The Fact That People Visit** **Graves Proves Nothing**

As a preliminary matter, I * don’t* think we should try to prove souls don’t perish on the basis that some people worship a kind of super natural spirit which they believe remains in the bodies of the dead 

\[ *e.g., by visiting a grave; cf. 161–162 below*\], and that rather than death wiping our souls out, this spirit allegedly proves mortal bodies were actually 

“tombs” for immortal souls. That would imply that many stronger arguments * aren’t* available to show how those who maintain that souls and bodies perish together, are fighting logic illogically. 

**Appeal to Authority: Socrates, Pythagoras**

\[153\] If it’s authorities we want, what more impos-ing authority can I cite than the man \[ *Socrates*\] that Apollo himself declared wisest of all? His life’s work was to assert at every turn that our souls are divine and that, freed of their bodies, they return to the heavens they came from.

Quod si secus esse quisquam putet, haud sane facile quid multis et firmissimis in hanc sententiam argumentis respondere possit, inveniet. 

Sic enim plane cognosci ac sensu ipso diiudicari potest, summam esse paeneque incredibilem in animis celeritatem ac festinationem, cuius ope, quae corpus non modo certo mensium sed vix etiam annorum spatio perficere atque exsequi posset, ea ipsi non modo semel puncto temporis percurrere, sed etiam saepius excogitare et repetere facillime queant. 

\[154\] Quod si mirum videtur, ¿cur non admirabilius censeatur meminisse animum tam multa innumerabilibus ante saeculis gesta, quae futura sunt cogitando prospicere ac non modo praesentia, sed etiam praeterita et futura veluti deum omnia complecti ac sub oculos subiicere conari? 

¿Quis dubitet, quum haec intellegat eademque in se ipso agnoscat, divinum esse animum, nec—si divina aeterna sunt— ipsum esse mortalem?

On that point, he agreed with the renowned philos o phers that antiquity once called “the Italians” 

\[ *Pythagoreans*\]. Their unwavering view was that souls descend from heaven, and that they’re not only a gift of the Divine Intelligence, but a special part of its essence \[ *cf. section 144*\]. 

Anyone who disagrees with that view is going to have trou ble finding ways to rebut the many strong arguments in its favor. 

**“Magical” Properties of the Soul:** **Speed, Memory, Motion**

For example, our senses alone can tell us souls possess an extreme, almost mind- boggling velocity and spontaneity. Tasks that would take our bodies months or even years to carry out and perfect, our minds can analyze, engineer, and iterate in an instant— and easily. 

\[154\] If that seems weird, isn’t it even *weirder* that the mind remembers so many events from countless ages past? That it predicts future outcomes? That, like a god, it seeks to comprehend in a single view not only the pre sent, but the past and future as well? 

When you think about this, when you recognize it in yourself, how could you doubt the soul is divine? And if what’s divine is eternal, that the soul is immortal?

Quum enim ex se ipso moveatur nec aliunde, ut cetera, principium motūs mutuetur; 

summa autem in eo, quamdiu in corpore est, perpetuitas motūs appareat— quippe quae etiam in dormientibus agnoscatur et vigeat— idcirco dubitari nullo modo potest quin divinus sit et sempiternus futurus. \[155\] Et sane ita esse, ratio vincit et rerum probat exitus. 

Dei enim imago quaedam animus est ex ipso deo delibata ac profecta. Quod si deus immortalitate fruitur, ¿cur eam partem quam ex se ipso sumpsit mortalem esse velit?

HOW TO GRIEVE

The soul’s eternal nature can be even more easily grasped from its two characteristic properties:

• It *initiates* motion, and

• Its motion is *uninterrupted*. 

You see, the soul moves *on its own*; unlike other things, it doesn’t get set in motion by something else. 

Moreover, the *uninterruptedness* of its motion is evident the whole time it’s inside the body, inasmuch as it’s active and observable even in people asleep. These facts prove beyond doubt that the soul is divine and will be everlasting. \[155\] Reason compels that conclusion, and real ity confirms it. 

You see, the soul is an image of God, sampled and emanating from God. Now, if God is immortal, why would He want the part He took from *Himself* to be mortal? 

No, that’s exactly *why* He felt obliged to hint that this strange, unparalleled power is divine: to show us He isn’t just immortal Himself, but also *shares* His immortal nature with those He chooses. 

The *body*, though, He *did* want mortal. And that makes sense, since it comes from the earth, whose nature is to change, and, when life’s course is complete, into earth it must return.

**The Soul’s Nature Cannot Be **

**Paralleled on Earth**

But the *soul*, having emanated from God, seeks the heavens themselves, for it forever longs to return to the place it came from. If anything gravitates toward the *earth*, it’s the body. \[156\] *Souls* must seek the eternal abode of the heavens, their true homeland, since **the origin of souls is not to be found on** **earth. You see, there’s nothing blended or amalgamated in souls, or anything that looks to be** **formed or made of earth. There’s not even anything humid, or airy, or fiery, since there’s nothing in natures of that kind which has the power** **of memory, understanding, or thought, and** **which can remember the past, foresee the future,** **and comprehend the pre sent. Divinities alone** **have those capabilities, and no source will ever be** **discovered from which a person could get them,** **except God. \[157\] There is, therefore, a unique nature and power in the soul, distinct from those** **more known and familiar natures.

**is, then, that reasons, that has volition, and that** **is alive, it is heavenly and divine, and hence must** **necessarily be eternal.

• the masterpieces of lit er a ture

• the im mense sums poured into monumental proj ects

• the fulfillment of so many grand ambitions we’ll *understand* that man would’ve *never* done those things if he didn’t believe the eons of eternity *mattered* to him.

that are obviously granted to no denizen of earth save man alone? Namely: to be an observer of the heavens and the goings on in the heavens, or to develop mastery of great and complicated subjects, whether they relate to improving morality, or gaining astronomical lore, or to training the mind and memory in advanced and complicated matters. \[160\] 

Don’t such amazing privileges *prove* that the soul is divine, and that its nature is sampled and drawn from nowhere but the heavens? 

**The Appeal to Attitudes toward Death** If souls did perish along with bodies, could the wisest among us * really* die so calmly? Would impulsive fools * really* resist death so frantically? 

Moments before dying \[ *399 BCE*\], we’re told, Socrates was discussing the immortality of the righteous and the happy life that follows death. Hence he drained the poison cup willingly and cheerfully—

as if he were being summoned not to death, but to inherit an empire. 

\[161\] By contrast, when people’s hearts remain fixated on earth, when they think only of crum-bling, earthbound concerns, we see them dragged kicking and screaming out of life. And understand-ably so, since peering into the eternity of their souls is excruciating agony. They believe eternal punishment awaits their sinful lives.

It makes you want to scream: *Fool\! How* *could you not know what birth meant? *

**The Appeal to Burial Customs**

And yet the fact that human life is eternal can’t be news to anyone; it can be easily known and understood from our ancestors’ religious ceremonies and rituals. You see, they wouldn’t have lavished such honor on their dead or left us all our vari ous tomb ceremonies if they hadn’t ascertained that the soul lives on in death, and that although the *body* passes into twilight, the *person* doesn’t vanish completely. 

\[162\] They evidently wanted to instill in us that death is *not* the destroyer of human life, that it does *not* result in nonexistence. Rather, it serves, if we’ve lived morally, as our best guide to another and far happier life. 

You see, when people live in accordance with nature, when they shun bad be hav iors that suffocate our God- given potential and breed every vice, it’s fitting for them to receive honors in life and tributes in death. That’s not just reasonable, it’s also the truest and *fairest* scenario. And who cares more about fairness than God?

**The Appeal to Man’s Sense of God**

\[163\] Of virtually all creatures, man alone possesses some knowledge of God. Unless a life of evil makes him evil and hated by God, therefore, he’ll surely fly to God. 

And *that* is the single best and strongest argument for human immortality: that *man alone is cognizant of* *the divine will and has a role in it*. He can be born in the wild, in a jungle; doesn’t matter. *Nature* inevitably teaches him that God exists and must be worshipped. 

\[164\] Isn’t that *amazing*? It ought to awe men and beasts alike— shame them, too, if pos si ble— that:

• Man is *related* to God. 

• No animal on earth, save man alone, is imbued with *knowledge* of God. 

• Nothing else in existence possesses *a soul drawn* *from* the Divine Intelligence. 

Yet is man’s blindness, his negligence, really so great that he *forgets* his divine relationship— and balks at *decamping* to God?\! 

You see, we must view death as nothing other than a decamping to the heavenly abode above. Reason proves the justice and truth of that view, and the long- standing, overwhelming consensus of our wisest thinkers confirms it.

\[170\] Nec, verò, credi velim me, quia dolori nimio repugnem, idcirco dolorem omni ex parte improbare, omnesque illius ex animo fibras evellendas existimare. Est enim quatenus homo doleat, et— quod prudenter a Crantore dictum est— sive secetur pars aliqua corporis sive avellatur, 182 

HOW TO GRIEVE

\[168\] Now, how can you be happy or content if you’re plagued by torment and dread? You can’t. You’ll actually be *doubly* unhappy, because you’ll not only be *creating* your own misery, you’ll also attract gossip and criticism from others— because nothing is more unbecoming or unmanly than exaggerated grief. 

Moreover, if abusing your *body* attracts criticism, do you expect that the vices the *soul* strug gles with won’t attract shame and stigma? 

Actually, they’re *more* compromising, *more* un-acceptable, because the abode they’ve occupied— 

the soul—is nobler than the body. 

\[169\] If exaggerated grief is disgraceful and merits rebuke, it follows automatically that if you give in to it, you’re unworthy of *any* kind of praise. You see, things are linked like propositions in logic, and their chains lead to truth. In debates and discus-sions, each point is connected to the last. Similarly, if you let yourself get tangled up in one weakness or vice, you’ll find yourself immediately overwhelmed and immiserated by many vices. 

ANGUISH IS OKAY WITHIN LIMITS

\[170\] But make no mistake. Just because I’m against *excessive* grief, doesn’t mean I object to *all* pain or think its every last root must be torn from our souls. 

There’s room for human anguish. As Crantor wisely remarked, if some part of our body gets amputated 183

Quibus rebus intellegitur graviter peccare homines, quum vel ea quae omnibus perferenda subeundaque sunt, detrectare audent, vel quid ipsos in vitā deceat, quaeque sequi aut refugere debeant, non cernunt satis.

\[171\] No, what I *do* object to is abandoning ourselves to grief so much that we find ourselves criticized for the opposite attitude, and maybe worse. 

You see, you’d come across as unnatural and inhuman if you felt *no* grief at all, since death is shocking and naturally forces out signs of pain and grief somehow. In the same way, if you *overindulge* in grief, people will say you’re forgetting what it means to be human, that you’re rejecting our universal condition. That shows how people go seriously astray when they dare refuse an ordeal we all must suffer, or when they can’t weigh options and decide a best path forward for themselves. 

Yet choice is the province of *discipline*, which the immortal gods undeniably set up as a brake on human be hav ior. \[172\] If you get carried away with excessive grief, it means you’re completely rejecting this magnificent gift from the gods. And you aren’t just surrendering yourself to tears and sorrow, which is pointless; you’re also being completely illogical. I mean,

We see the opposite happen, though. Anyone who ignores such acts is not only unpop u lar, but even accused of selfishness and inhumanity. 

ON ALTRUISM AND CHARITY

You see, we aren’t carved from marble or hewn from oak. There’s something in us that’s moved by pity and compassion, something that won’t let us stifle the spiritual desire to help and support others. 

\[174\] It seems to be innate and instinctive in us that, every time we see another person down on their luck or in distress, even a total stranger, it tugs at our heartstrings. We feel that if it’s in our power, we can’t ignore an opportunity to help out. It’s like 187

188 

HOW TO GRIEVE

Nature’s telling us in a silent “voice” to show the same kindness to another that we’d hope to receive if we were in that position ourselves. 

So, if we doubt certain accidents can happen to us, but they do, why get distraught or upset? Why not admit instead that those accidents are part of the human condition and can happen to any of us? \[175\] 

Such was the wisdom of the sage who recognized:

“I’m human, and I think nothing human is alien to me.”24

This idea that “evils aren’t all part of the human condition” is like an invasive, predatory beast. Once we expunge it from our hearts, we will, rest assured, live life less anxiously, less miserably. It’ll dawn on us that, come what may, we *must* endure it courageously, and that *nothing* can happen to man that should leave him lying in despair. And we’ll get there if, instead of flattering ourselves, we wholeheartedly embrace the truth, which is the finest, most sublime, and most precious thing in the world. 

It’s by facing the *truth* that we become better and more resilient in enduring adversity and accomplishing great tasks, \[176\] since we’ll accept nothing other than what’s fair and right, and we’ll aspire to nothing less than the greatness that begets true glory.

THE DEAD DO NOT WANT US TO GRIEVE

\[177\] I’ve said that searing, prolonged grief must be avoided; and rightfully so, since it tends to give rise to many very serious prob lems, and never anything good. 

You see, grief isn’t one of those things where you see many strong, equally valid reasons for and against it. If you did, I’d be less bold; I wouldn’t let myself into a spot from which I see no way out. But that’s the real ity, so I reiterate my point that we must master our emotions and fight grief viciously. Whether it’s our selves or our public persona we’re thinking of, there’s no question that *that* is what we must do. 

\[178\] Moreover, consider the dead themselves. 

How could we imagine *they*’d enjoy us being wracked with grief, especially since it does *them* no good and it brings *us* enormous shame and distress?

HOW TO GRIEVE

So, what *should* we decide they want from us? 

Nothing at all, except for us to honor them with a few nice thoughts and remembrances. As Ennius says, 

♫ *No one should honor me with tears\! *♫

Why? Because—

♫ *I’m alive, everywhere, on the lips of men\! *♫

\[179\] Why does he reject weeping and tears? Obviously, it’s the glory he felt he’d won while still alive. 

For the same reason, therefore, let’s assume *our* grief will displease and annoy the dead. Let’s believe they demand nothing more from us than that one tribute we love most, \[180\] namely glory, and forever remembering their good qualities. And if our words and eulogies were capable of making that glorious memory everlasting, then by that, and that alone, we could believe we’ve done our level best for the dead. 

WE MUST CULTIVATE GREATNESS 

AND GRATITUDE

What about the idea our greatest thinkers offer us, that if you let yourself sink irretrievably into despair, you’re second- guessing God? \[181\] Well, it’s sinful to repay those to whom we owe every thing with rank ingratitude.

HOW TO GRIEVE

By contrast, consider those who submitted to the gods’ will and made clear they resented nothing the gods put in their path. Antiquity not only exalted them during their lifetimes, it also consecrated them with perpetual honors after they’d departed life— 

and did so all the more eagerly and enthusiastically for those who wedded *religious* devotion to personal greatness and generous philanthropy. 

As so often, our ancestors were spot on. \[182\] 

I mean, what’s more impressive in all the world than seeing a man of integrity crown an unwavering reverence for the gods with a total commitment to his fellow humans? And that in his heart, there isn’t the slightest hint of anything at odds with piety, with humanity, or indeed, with greatness? 

\[183\] And that explains exactly why we see all of life misaligned by ignorance and error. You see, the qualities that * ought* to be man’s priorities in life— 

piety, philanthropy, and personal greatness— are practically all neglected. By the same token, we eagerly seek out the things we should most avoid; some blind striving impels us to embrace the things that utterly degrade and debase our lives. It’s the source of insatiable desires which cause us to witness not only individual people, but whole families and entire civilizations wiped out. It gives rise to in-surrections, plots, polarization, and the ruinous destruction of property and people. It also leads to 195

\[184\] It’s a dif fer ent world for those who cultivate greatness. By conforming to the will of the gods \[ *cf. 181*\], they trust all that they have, not to themselves, but to the gods. They do no one harm; they embrace one and all with generosity, kindness, and love. They are beyond anxiety and beyond desire, because they’ve halted every onslaught of temptation and torn the roots of greed and craving from their souls. 

Great Souls Are Sainted in Heaven

It was natu ral, therefore, that when people had lived and died with a clear conscience, pleased the gods, and served their fellow man, our ancestors deemed them worthy of divine honors. 

Our wisest poet \[ *Ennius*\] had a point in declaring that they’re spending eternity with the immortal gods. 

Of course, he didn’t say that because anyone could actually believe their *bodies* were taken up into heaven. There’s no need to believe that, since Nature doesn’t allow something that is *of* the earth to remain anywhere but *on* earth. No, he meant we believe their *souls* have been elevated to heaven, 197

because they belonged to people whose conduct toward the immortal gods and humankind merited the ultimate reward. 

\[185\] Such, tradition tells us, was the fate of Ro-mulus, founder of our city. His phenomenal contribution to humankind of founding this awesome city earned him admission to the ranks of the gods. 

What’s more, that was already a time when people were enlightened by lit er a ture and science and could easily separate fact from fiction, truth from falsehood. They couldn’t be hoodwinked into believing anything that smacked of falsehood or fabrication. 

\[186\] But glory, greatness, and philanthropic ser-vice didn’t just earn that mortal man belief in his *immortality*; they de cided he was a *god*. Now, ancient chronicles tell us the same tribute was paid to others, too, so that upon dying, they were welcomed into the ranks of the gods. 

This belief first arose among the Greeks and then apparently spread to us. For example, Hercules, Bacchus, Castor, Pollux, and a great many women who are now believed to occupy a special place among the gods, were no less human and no less born from humans.25 But they made themselves great and endeavored to become a beacon to others in the ways of justice and humanity. Hence, in remembering their ser vice, the awe of men found a place for them in the palace and pantheon of heaven.

It’s also simple to see that even those we call “the original gods” started here among us before ascend-ing into heaven. So did countless others that we’ve elevated to the ranks of the gods.26

\[187\] That said, the strongest validation of our belief about them is the overwhelming consensus of all those enlightened men over all those centuries. 

That consensus seems to be the voice of truth itself. 

Besides, it’s hard to imagine any *other* place suit-able for true greatness such as theirs. \[188\] When you realize that their integrity, generosity, and unparalleled greatness puts them closest to the gods, you’d be out of your mind to think they deserve a place *separate* from the gods\! 

Moreover, given that our souls disdain earthiness and forever gravitate upward, can heaven * really* be denied to those who were so very heavenly, not only naturally and instinctively, but by their voluntary choices and actions? \[189\] My own view is that the brighter or better their generosity or greatness il-luminated mankind, the more reasonable it is that they’re in heaven. 

Take Hercules, for example. Who was ever braver, more disciplined, or in better control of his appetites? What labors did he *not* take on and complete in order to flex his bravery and benefit mankind? What pain and reversals did he *not* suffer?

And it’s the same for others we look up to— each heroic in their own way, all of them superhuman in their devotion to gods or men. 

People de cided, therefore, that lead- wrought statues and fading crowns of laurel couldn’t last long enough to reward such epic exploits. Instead, they sought more perennial and stable gifts to exalt those who chose greatness over comfort, honor over appetite, glory over plea sure, and indeed, over life itself. 

SIN LEADS TO HELL

If that’s reasonable, moreover, it’s no less appropriate for the good and morally upright to *not* have the same afterlife abode as the wicked. \[191\] You see, our wisest ancestors understood that justice thrives above all among the *gods*, and that it’s most clearly vis i ble in their works. Hence, they understood, the gods must necessarily abhor wickedness and criminality; they must keep those who pursued it in life as far away from themselves as pos si ble.

\[194\] In recognizing that, we must repress the cravings that too often attract us to things that impede greatness. Success will come most easily if we stay focused on the outcome of this glorious strug gle. 

Moreover, the focusing *itself* is so sweet that we’ll do the job willingly and cheerfully, and we’ll complete it with no trou ble at all. You can actually see that in the case of exceptional and glory- seeking people. Their energy and commitment to facing military battles or fighting courtroom battles or to entering politics tends to be so great that either they don’t feel the danger and exhaustions those undertakings entail, or they disregard them. 

\[195\] You see, for a competitor locked in a strug-gle for glory, an incredible pain blocker or shock absorber is the hope of the immediate advantage or glory that awaits. That’s true not only in major efforts and pursuits, but in minor ones, too. For example, you can see sprinters or game hunters exhausted and on the brink of collapse, yes, but never any sign that they’re less committed or into it.

*That* is the model. When the splendor of greatness fills your eyes and the pursuit of glory capti-vates your heart, you don’t feel fatigue. Even if you do fi nally become aware of it, it hardly makes any difference, since you’re so completely in the zone to help your country and immortalize your name. 

And even if you think that’s negligible— that the satisfaction of a job well done is good enough— you obviously can’t discount the divine honors traditionally granted to heroic men. Other wise, you’d seem to be disparaging the very gods who accepted those same honors themselves. 

APOTHEOSIS AND THE FOSTERING 

OF GREATNESS

\[197\] As for the peoples who *introduced* that practice \[ *of declaring men gods*\], their wisdom and im-partiality are so celebrated that they undoubtedly had some *reason* for doing what they did. Among them we can count:

• The Spartans. Those courageous and illustrious heroes would traditionally bestow divine honors on citizens who fell fighting for their homeland.

• And what about that famed cradle of education and wisdom, Athens? In recognition of his exceptional patriotism and ser vices, didn’t they enthusiastically vote to deify their King Codrus 

\[ *eleventh century BCE*\]? 

\[198\] I do tend to think some highly enlightened minds were right to decide that the deification of great heroes was contrived to foster courage and a gung-ho attitude in patriots. You see, *glory* is the true reward for courage, and nothing can inspire a high-minded person to virtuous action more. The best country to realize that, and the one to practice deification longest, was Greece. That illustrious patron of arts and sciences has made *many* gods out of people in recognition of their greatness. Some of them, they grant, are recent, while they maintain others were canonized and received into heaven many centuries ago. If you scrutinize their arcane lit er a ture, you might be able to find out the total number. 

\[199\] That said, I haven’t been speaking about these issues at such length because I want to suggest they were all deified impulsively or unthinkingly. Indeed, I revere them myself and do think they should be considered gods. 

No, I’m struck that we find that so *many* have been paid the tribute of immortality and divine honors, and among practically all nations. My aim, 211

therefore, was to inspire the minds of good people to earn the rewards that our sages deem greatest. 

You see, man can meet with no finer or more blessed fate than admission to a place that our founding fathers avoided no danger, no strug gle, and no suffering to ascend to. 

And if it’s just one’s own best interests we take into account, then *this* is the one and only reward which an enlightened and educated man should desire or aspire to. 

\[200\] And just *look* at the awe and pride that’s inspired in the masses by the temples that are vowed and dedicated to them\! And naturally so, since anyone who worships those temple gods in public has to admit those gods were once people, and that by greatness alone they ascended to the ranks of the gods and acceded to divine honors. 

\[201\] It’s also no surprise that gods born of god fathers or god mothers are publicly worshipped, and their shrines and temples kept reverentially and piously adorned. Worshipping *them* is holy, religious, and fully consistent with piety and propri-ety, so it’s not surprising or concerning at all; it’s natu ral, a simple matter of birth. The very laws of pedigree dictate that a child born of a god or goddess ought to be a god.

By contrast, it can sound counterintuitive for a person born of a * human* father or *mortal* mother to be a god. For many, that tends to give rise to not-entirely- unwarranted skepticism. \[202\] It’s not that anyone doubts or denies that if the greatness of such heroes is granted extraordinary honors, then they’re *granted* legitimately. No, it’s our idea that greatness *itself* has some power to actually transform biology. 

*That* is the point where educated people tend, not unreasonably, to become quizzical. 

In reply, however, they’ve been told that greatness does *not* transform biology, that that’d be impossible without fundamentally changing the person, and that their ge ne tic makeup remains intact when the soul flies to the gods and is initiated into their com pany, since the soul is immortal and a partner in divine immortality, while the body, which is mortal by nature, remains on earth, and there’s no way that something of the earth can shed its nature and don one that’s alien to it.

HEROIC AND SAINTLY MODELS ARE INSPIRING

And since I’m chasing down every thing impor tant or worth knowing on this topic \(or trying to, any-way\), I must also address the number and dif fer ent *forms* of greatness that have been canonized in a bid to inspire and uplift humankind. The goal of those efforts is public improvement, to impress on people that they too can hope to attain those honors if they achieve the same kind of greatness. 

\[204\] On that topic, a great deal of good lies in imitation. A lot of people willingly seek out and imitate the actions they see as responsible for others getting the things they want themselves. Hence, it frequently happens that modeling themselves on great men awakens a sense of heroism for many, and in many situations they’d never even thought about before; and once heroism starts pumping, needless to say, it makes rapid gains in pro gress and musculature. 

\[205\] You see, it’s common knowledge that virtually all great things start from small beginnings. 

Step- by- step imitation is what gradually bolsters and develops them to a point where they cannot rise or increase further. 

Hence, if there’s any area where we should en-dorse imitation, I can’t see any more worthy for 217

LESS WORTHY CANDIDATES

\[206\] *Many* forms of greatness are deservedly revered, not only because they are inherently worth cultivating or worshipping, but also because they produce many boons for the whole human race.27 

Hence, I really would like to know why the Egyptians have deified *animals* as well— and practically all of them. 

I have no prob lem with a fish being regarded and worshipped as a god \[ *Atargatis*\] among the Syrians, people who aren’t bright or educated enough to realize how stupid and ridicu lous that is.

That’d mean no less than flipping the natu ral hierarchy on its head— and even though we recognize the utopian voodoo behind *that* idea, will we stubbornly defend * these* thoroughly bizarre ideas \[ *deifying animals*\] all the same?— And by the same magical thinking, Egypt has set onions, garlic, and all the other vegetables that grow out of the ground among the ranks of the gods. \[209\] I don’t know that it’s necessary to re-fute these ideas at great length; their absurdity is so palpable that even the greatest stubbornness and ignorance in the world wouldn’t try to defend them.

LEGITIMATE APOTHEOSES

Let no one doubt, therefore, the legitimacy of hail-ing as gods, and inscribing in the pantheon, those who contributed to helping or improving and elevating human life, and whose greatness and magnificent accomplishments brought them glory.

Tu, ergo, quando me insigni et excellenti tuarum laude memoriāque virtutum tam praeclare iuvisti, nunc ab hominibus seiuncta, non me deserens, sed aliquando respectans, perduc eo, ubi tuā tandem collocutione conspectuque fruar, ut et parenti tui amantissimo quam potissimum optare debes gratiam referas, et ego multo mihi gratiorem multoque iucundiorem congressum nostrum futurum intellegam, quàm insuavis et acerbus digressus fuit.

HOW TO GRIEVE

TULLIA IN HEAVEN AND THE TRIUMPH 

OVER DEATH

But now the lessons of wisdom have hardened me against all the vio lence of Fortune, and *you* are a god in heaven. It fills me with all the plea sure and happiness a heart can hold. I’m trembling all over with joy, and I triumph in victory over Fortune and all her sorrow. 

Tullia, the awesome glory and memory of your greatness and your virtues were always of such wonderful help to me. Now that you’re apart from mortals, don’t forsake me\! No, turn your eyes toward me. *Lead* me to the place where, at long last, I can look upon and speak with you. That way, *you* can repay the father who loves you with all his heart, repay him however you like; and *I*’ll make sure that the joy of our reunion eclipses all the heartache and pain I felt at saying goodbye. 

THE END

NOTES

1. Robert Harris’s 2015 novel *Dictator* brings these sad events vividly to life. Long before him, in the third century CE, the Roman historian Cassius Dio composed an imaginary scene of Cicero being consoled on his exile by a man in Macedonia \( *Roman* *History* 38.18–29\). 

2. *Divine Institutes* 3.28. This passage is reflected in sections 216–217 of our treatise. 

3. *Tusculan Disputations* 4.63, *naturae vim attulimus* \(reflected in sections 5 and 87 here\), and *Letter to* *Atticus* 12.14.3 \(March 8, 45 BCE\): *Quin etiam feci,* *quod profecto ante me nemo, ut ipse me per litteras* *consolarer. *

4. Voltaire 1765 in Appelgate 1974, 45; his adjacent essay, “An Impor tant Study by Lord Bolingbroke” 

\(ibid., 93–214\) discusses the evolution of Chris tian-ity. Cicero himself believed in heaven, but not in hell \( *Tusculan Disputations* 1.10 and elsewhere; the statement in section 192 here is an aberration\); two centuries later, in his own treatise *Grief*, Lucian— 

the Voltaire of his times— laughs at the very idea of hell. King 2020 examines traditional \(pagan\) Roman attitudes toward death and the afterlife. 

233

NOTES

5. Graver 2002 collects the fingerprints of Crantor in the *Tusculan Disputations*; Curtius 2021 is the finest translation. 

6. Forsyth et al. 1999. 

7. The text was originally printed in book 4 of his letters, and then reprinted in his translation of *The* *Complete Works of St. Plato*. The quote appears in the subsection titled “Quantum Plato Neglexit . . .” 

8. In his third and final defense, printed posthumously, Sigonius affirmatively denied it \(Garisendus 1599, 11–12\): “I neither wrote nor published this book, nor advised anyone else to publish it. All I did was believe in it once it was published . . .” It may be significant that Sigonius doesn’t deny knowing who wrote it. I agree with McCuaig 1989 that Sigonius’s vari ous defenses of the text seem to demonstrate bad faith. 

9. Baltussen 2013. 

10. Theophrastus \(371–287 BCE\) was head of Aristotle’s Lyceum. His lost book *Callisthenes: On Grief* espoused the maxim “Fortune, not wisdom, rules life” 

\(quoted by Cicero as ♫ *Vitam regit fortuna, non sapientia*♫ in *Tusculan Disputations* 5.25\). Xenocrates \(396–314 BCE\) was head of Plato’s Acad emy and Crantor’s teacher. No book on grief by him is attested elsewhere, but he did write a treatise *On* *Death*. In the Re nais sance, Marsilio Ficino claimed the pseudo- Platonic *Axiochus* was that treatise. Since *Axiochus* is a consolation, it seems likely that our author followed Ficino’s lead \(see note 7 above\)— and 234 

NOTES

hence committed a blunder that hints at the Re naissance origin of our text. 

11. An astonishing statement, and all the more amazing because “the one word” that sums up woman’s misery, *parére* \(obey\), looks the same as *párere* \(to bear children\). 

12. The Syrian poet Archias, whom Cicero defended on a charge of illegal immigration 17 years before his daughter’s death, has an epigram on this very theme \( *Greek Anthology* 9.111 = Gow- Page 18\): Praised be the Thracians\! because— get this— they *grieve* for their children coming here into the light out of their mothers’ 

womb. 

By contrast, they *bless* every one who departs this existence

when Fate’s apparitor, Doom, snatches them each by surprise. 

Why? Because, whereas the living endure the gamut of heartaches

all life long, the dead fi nally discover their cure. 

13. In Latin more obviously than En glish, “nature” means 

“birth.” 

14. The tale of Silenus \(which features in Nietz sche’s *Birth of Tragedy*\), the séance, and the fragment of Euripides alluded to \(a famous passage of the lost *Cresphontes*, fr. 449\) all appear in *Tusculan Disputations* 1.114–115. The first two are also found in Plutarch’s 235

NOTES

*Consolation to Apollonius* \(27, 14\), along with other quotations from Euripides’ *Cresphontes* \(15\). The common source is obviously Crantor’s treatise *Grief*. 

15. As explained in the introduction, this quotation comes not from Plato but Marsilio Ficino’s Renaissance- era *Life of Plato*. 

16. Fabricated to look like a snatch of Homer or Ennius. 

17. A word to the wise, since we still hear this line of argument on occasion: In *Tusculan Disputations* 1.83, Cicero states that Ptolemy II Philadelphus \(308–246 

BC\) banned the teaching of this irresponsible idea in schools because students began taking it seriously, and committing suicide. \(In par tic u lar, he censored one teacher, Hegesias of Cyrene, who’d written a book on the topic titled *Fatal Fortitude*.\) 18. Plausible, but fabricated. Gorgias died at the age of 107. 

19. Cicero is making an untranslatable connection here between fortitude and *fortis vir*, the usual Latin expression for a “real man.” 

20. This glorious quotation is a total fabrication. The implication of “somewhere” is “not in *Callisthenes:* *On Grief*” \(see note 10\). 

21. A famous scene too laconically told here. *Tusculan* *Disputations* 1 and Xenophon *Hellenica* 2.3.56 have the fuller version. 

22. This was to be Cicero’s own fate in 43 BCE. 

23. Ennius’s *Epicharmus* fragments 7 and 8. 

24. Terence’s *Self- Tormentor* 77, a famous quotation that was to have a rich heritage. 

236 

NOTES

25. One example of a deified woman is Ino, daughter of Cadmus. She became the goddess Matuta. 

26. In *City of God* 8.5, Augustine claims these “original gods” include Jupiter, Juno, and others. He adds that one scholar sought to interpret them allegorically, as ele ments of the universe, but that they were really originally human. 

27. A fascinating exploitation of the two meanings of *colere*: \(1\) to cultivate and \(2\) to worship. The author transitions from speaking about the private cultivation of greatness \( *virtus*\) in one’s personal development, to the Roman public practice of worshipping the abstract Virtues as goddesses, complete with priests and temples: a cult. 

28. Their children are respectively Ino, Hercules, and the brothers Castor and Pollux. 

29. Allegedly, Cicero’s exclamation is the cry of a defeated gladiator “tapping out.”
