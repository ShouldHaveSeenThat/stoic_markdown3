INTRODUCTION





When was the last time you gave someone a gift? Perhaps it was on an occasion when gifts are expected—a birthday, or wedding, or graduation. Or perhaps you gave spontaneously, “out of the goodness of your heart,” as the expression goes. Perhaps you treated a date to a meal, or brought a bottle of wine to a dinner party, or wrote a check to a charity or cause. Probably you did not stop to consider the moral meaning of your action, or fully appreciate the fact that, in the eyes of the Roman writer Seneca, you were, in some small way, saving the world. Your ability to give, as Seneca discussed in his treatise *De Beneficiis*, or *On Benefits*, is an essential part of what makes you human, and if your giving is done in the right spirit, it can even bring you close to the divine.

As a thinker of the Stoic school, Seneca saw a divine plan behind all human activity, especially the giving of gifts and doing of favors. His philosophy had strong underpinnings in religious belief. He speaks of a “Guiding Principle, from which things take their form” \(1.6, on p. 23\), though he sometimes imagines this as composed of a plurality of beings, or equates it with Nature or with the stars and planets. In the end, he claims at one point \(4.7, pp. 135–37\), it’s not important what name we give to “the first cause of all things,” whether we make it singular or plural, or whether we personify it, so long as we strive to follow the inner promptings it has instilled in us. The impulse toward generosity, he maintains—the “goodness of our hearts”—is foremost among these.

How does the human race survive, Seneca asks, lacking the speed, strength, and ferocity of other animals? Only through our two unique attributes \(4.18\): Reason and what Seneca calls *societas*, the social impulse, here rendered “Fellowship” for want of a better translation. Our ability to help one another, to pool our resources, to *give*, has elevated us above the wild creatures that otherwise outstrip us, and indeed has made us masters of creation. \(Seneca was not well versed enough in the natural world to spot a similar social impulse in other animals, and he knew little of the apes and monkeys that share this trait with human beings.\)

In Seneca’s eyes, we did not develop these abilities over time, as a modern evolutionary biologist might claim. Our impulse toward generosity was “hard-wired” from the start. We are *meant* to be generous beings, just as we are meant to be virtuous in other ways, to employ reason to guide our actions, and to prevent virulent emotions—anger in particular, as well as fear, especially fear of death—from throwing our minds off course. These are core principles of the Stoic school, explored by Seneca in the many prose treatises and open letters he published throughout his life. \(My two other volumes in the “Ancient Wisdom for Modern Readers” series, *How to Keep Your Cool* and *How to Die*, present Seneca’s thinking on the problem of disruptive emotions—anger in the first case, fear of death in the second.\)

In the treatise excerpted here, *De Beneficiis*, or *On Benefits*, Seneca sought to strengthen the giving impulse and heighten our awareness of how much we gain by following it, and how much we lose by ignoring or perverting it. Selfishness, timidity, egoism, greed, and a dozen other failings, in Seneca’s view, get in the way of our divine natures. We decline to give, or we give badly, lording our gift over those who receive it, seeking renown for having given, or expecting something in exchange, a return for our “gift”—in that case a gift no longer, but something more like a loan, bribe, or business transaction. On the other side of the gifting relationship, we often also *get* badly, without the sense of gratefulness that makes us want to be givers ourselves. Our ingratitude makes others less willing to give, and the binding ties of *societas* begin to fray.

*On Benefits* is the longest of Seneca’s extant essays, an indication of the importance he gave to its theme. He may well have added to it over time, for the last three of its seven books have a very different tenor than the first four, and the seventh book contains some off-topic material that feels like a later accretion. Even after completing it, he still had more to say on the subject, for he devoted one of his *Moral Epistles* to the same subject, characterizing that letter as an extension and expansion of *On Benefits*. A portion of that letter is included in this volume; its publication date is known to be 64 AD, just before Seneca’s death. *On Benefits* might have been composed at any point during the eight years before that, or perhaps over much of that time span.

During all of those eight years, and indeed beginning slightly before \(in 54 AD\), Seneca lived a double life, composing philosophic essays and tragic dramas, but also serving as chief minister to Nero, ruler of Rome, whom he had tutored as a youth. Nero succeeded to the role of *princeps*, what we now generally term “emperor,” at seventeen, an age at which he badly needed the advice and moral authority of an older man. Seneca, a respected statesman, writer, and thinker three times Nero’s age, provided the new regime with that authority. Seneca worked closely with Nero for a decade, growing extremely wealthy in the meanwhile, but as the partnership deteriorated \(along with Nero’s sanity\), he found himself trapped. Though he offered to surrender his huge estate, Nero \(according to an account of his thinking set down by the historian Tacitus\) would not accept the bargain or permit him to depart the palace. Allowing Seneca to return what he had received, Nero reasoned \(again in Tacitus’s account\), would make the regime look predatory. After further estrangement, in 65 AD, the emperor seized on ambiguous evidence to accuse Seneca of treason and force him to commit suicide.

Because Seneca had gotten fabulously rich, quite possibly with the help of Nero’s handouts, and then found it impossible to give back what he’d accepted, the topic of gifts and giving held special meaning in his life. One would not guess this from *On Benefits*, however. With a discretion born of the perils of tyranny, Seneca kept his own life, and political career, offstage in this treatise, as in almost all his other writings. Even when he refers to “attendants of royal power” \(2.5\) who keep petitioners waiting before dispensing favors, he gives no hint that he himself was on most mornings surrounded by such petitioners, “clients” \(*clientes*\) in Roman parlance, who needed imperial help and sought Seneca’s support. Thus, Seneca’s paradoxical position at Nero’s court, a powerful man capable of dispensing favors, but also a prisoner of those he had received, underlies this text. Just how much the life influenced the work is a matter of debate.

Rather than pursue that complex \(and probably unanswerable\) question, let us take *On Benefits* on its own terms: as an exhortation toward generosity and gratitude, not as a self-critique or self-defense from a man weighed down by Nero’s gifts. Let us look to it for an expression of Seneca’s most cherished beliefs: the certainty that a divine plan guided and protected the human race, a plan established by benevolent gods; the conviction that the fallibility of all human beings demands reciprocal clemency and forgiveness; a sense of wonder at the world’s beauty and plenitude, somehow coupled with a fear that it is descending into chaos \(as in the grim image of the besieged city and its pillagers at 7.27, put forward as “a true picture of human life”\). Above all, let us enjoy the rhetorical art of a first-rate wordsmith: sweeping crescendos and soaring imagery, kaleidoscopic shifts of tone and voice, and fiery verbal duels—Seneca’s specialty—with imagined opponents, summoned out of the ether to serve as foils and straw men.

Many of these pyrotechnics, however, present problems for the translator. The difficulties in this case begin from the very title of the essay. *De Beneficiis* is usually translated “On Benefits,” for lack of any other English equivalent for Latin *beneficium*—a word that combines our notions of “gift,” “favor,” and “good turn.” In her extensive 2013 study of the essay, *Seneca on Society*, classicist Miriam Griffin opined that “benefit” is the only viable way to render *beneficium*, and at first I shared that opinion*.* But not only is “benefit” ungainly, it also conjures up, for American readers at least, the health and pension plans obtained through employment contracts. The problem is compounded in that Seneca speaks of *beneficia* constantly throughout the essay, so that the shortcomings of “benefit” must be revisited over and over. In the end, I largely jettisoned the word and adopted a wide array of alternatives: “gifts and good deeds,” most commonly, but sometimes only one or the other, as well as “favor,” “good turn,” “boon,” or the gerund “giving,” this last version especially useful in passages where Seneca speaks of *beneficium* as an activity or a process.

As with all Seneca’s essays, the modern translator confronts the chauvinism of the Greco-Roman world when dealing with gendered pronouns. Like his contemporaries, Seneca addressed himself largely to males, on the assumption that, since males dominated politics and statecraft, it was their moral improvement that mattered most. His exemplars and hypothetical actors are invariably male, to judge by the masculine gender of associated Latin words. It seemed wrong to me to perpetuate this gender bias, but also wrong, or at least anachronistic, to introduce female pronouns where Seneca and his age would never have used them. I have dealt with this problem by pluralizing many of Seneca’s singular pronouns, converting “he” either to “they” or “we,” or by using “you say” in cases where Seneca introduces an unnamed opponent with *inquit* \(“he/she says”\). This did not seem to me a distortion, since Seneca himself mixes first-, second-, and third-person statements, following no discernible pattern, when making moral assertions or imagining responses of an interlocutor. Wherever a singular third-person pronoun seemed stronger or clearer than the alternatives, I have chosen to preserve the masculine “he” of Seneca’s admittedly patriarchal text.

The excerpts I have selected from *On Benefits* represent less than a quarter of the entire essay. *De Beneficiis* was not only Seneca’s longest work but also his most specific and thorough: much of it deals with highly specific, even recondite problems of giving and receiving, of less interest to modern readers than its more far-reaching goals. In my selections, I have favored the broadest, most inspirational passages of the work, especially those dealing with the gods, for gods are crucial to Seneca’s thinking about humanity.

The gods, according to Seneca—conceived here not as the Olympian deities of mythology but as vague, impersonal forces—provide us with the ultimate model of giving and doing good. The world they have provided is beautiful and filled with nurture, even if we have made it into a chaos resembling the sack of a captured city. They never withhold their generosity and never expect a return. In their benevolence, they have instilled in us an impulse to give—“the goodness of our hearts”—that knits together the very fabric of civilization. It is Seneca’s conviction that we have been blessed by the divine, expressed sometimes in the ecstatic tones of a pulpit preacher, that, I hope, will bring his teachings home to modern readers and prompt deeper reflections about what we do when we give.





HOW TO GIVE





ON BENEFITS





*As with all his works, Seneca addressed* On Benefits *to a single friend or family member—in this case, a man named Aebutius Liberalis, about whom almost nothing is known. Perhaps his name, which includes the word* liberalis*, “generous,” partly explains why Seneca directed this essay to him. In any case, the idea of a single addressee is largely a fictional conceit, as Seneca clearly wanted to be read widely by the general public.*

*Seneca begins his discussion of giving and receiving with a loose collection of introductory thoughts, many of which touch on his central themes: giving is not like lending, since no return should be expected or demanded; gratitude is essential, but ingratitude should be pardoned; intention and attitude are central aspects of generosity; we should emulate the gods in our open-handedness. After this sweeping overview, Seneca gets down to a more rigorous set of teachings in chapter 5 \(p. 177\).*

\[1.1\]1 Among many and various mistakes made by those who live heedlessly and recklessly, my most excellent Liberalis, I can name few things more egregious than this: We don’t know how to give and receive. The result is that the gifts we have given badly become total losses. By the time we complain about not being repaid, it’s too late; they were already lost at the moment they were given. And it’s hardly a surprise that among all our greatest and most numerous vices, none are more common than those that arise from an ungrateful heart.2 The causes of this, as I see it, are multiple.

First, we don’t select worthy recipients when we give. By contrast, when we set out to *lend*,3 we look into the estate and lifestyle of the borrower; when planting, we don’t scatter seeds onto worn-out, sterile soil. Yet we *strew* our gifts without any discernment, rather than *give* them.

I couldn’t easily say whether it’s worse to reject what one has received or demand back what one has given. The nature of this kind of transaction is that we must accept only that which is freely offered. A bankruptcy is shameful if one seeks to clear one’s accounts only by financial means and not by *good intent*. It’s those who *feel* indebted who’ve repaid.

The fault lies not only in those who won’t even admit to a sense of gratitude, but also in ourselves. We *find* many ingrates, but we *make* more; we are sometimes harshly demanding and critical, sometimes flighty and regretful of our gift just after we give it, sometimes quarrelsome and prone to pick fights over tiny things. Thus, we ruin all sense of gratitude, not just *after* we give but even while we are giving.

Who among us was ever content to respond to a request made casually or only once? Who, when supposing that something was being asked of him, did not knit the brow, turn away the face, pretend to be busy, and, with long conversations that strive never to find an end, deprive the asker of the chance to make a request, dodging pressing needs by diverse ploys? Or, when backed into a corner, who did not delay \(which is only a cowardly form of refusal\), or promise to do it, but grudgingly, with furrowed brow, with bitter words barely forced out between clenched teeth? But no one willingly repays what was not received but extorted.

Can anyone be grateful when facing one who haughtily did him a favor or tossed him a gift, or angrily shoved it at him, or gave it wearily, simply to be rid of the bother? It’s wrong to think that someone’s going to give back after being worn down by delay and tortured by anticipation. Gifts and good deeds are returned in the same spirit in which they’re given, and so must not be given heedlessly. Those who get something given thoughtlessly think their debt is only to themselves. And gifts must not be given tardily: In every kind of service, we value the willingness of the giver, and those who delay will seem to be *un*willing.

Gifts and good deeds must not be given with an edge of insult. It’s a pattern in human nature that injuries get deeper under our skin than boons; they take hold in our memory, while boons flow quickly away. What can we expect if we give offense while doing a good turn? Merely to be pardoned for such a gift would be gratitude enough.

\[1.1.9\] But the sheer proliferation of ingrates should not make us slow to be generous. First, as I said, *we* increase their number. Second, not even the immortal gods themselves are deterred from abundant and unceasing kindness by the impious people who neglect them. They follow their own natures; they give aid to all, even to those who are bad interpreters of their gifts. Let’s follow their lead, insofar as our human obtuseness allows. Let’s *give*, not lend out for profit. Those who think when they give about what they will get in return deserve to be cheated of that return.

“But let’s say things turn out poorly.”4 Our children and our spouses have often disappointed us, yet we still marry and raise them. Indeed, we’re so stubbornly tenacious, in defiance of experience, that we go back to war after a defeat or to the sea after a shipwreck. How much more fitting then to stay the course in giving\!

If someone doesn’t give because he didn’t receive, then he only gave *in order to* receive; he supplies the ingrates—whose vice is to avoid giving back whenever possible—with just cause. How many are unworthy of the sunshine, yet the day still dawns\! How many complain of being born into this world—yet Nature begets a new generation, and brings into being the same people who would prefer not to have been.

Here’s the mark of great and good hearts: To seek good deeds for their own sake, not for the profits that flow from them, and to look for good people even after meeting bad ones. What magnificence would there be in doing good for many, if none of them ever took advantage?

\[1.2.3\] Accountancy of good deeds is a simple matter: A certain amount is dispensed; if anything comes back, that’s a profit, but if not, it’s no loss. I gave for the purpose of giving. No one writes down good deeds on a ledger or calls them in by day and hour like a greedy collection agent. A good person never thinks of them, unless reminded by the one making return; to do otherwise is to make them into a *loan*. It’s a base kind of usury to treat a gift as an account payable. Whatever has happened in the case of prior gifts and good deeds, keep going, extend them to others. Better that these abide with the ungrateful, who might be made grateful at some point—by shame, by opportunity, or by imitation of their betters.

Don’t give up; carry through with your job, fulfill the part of a good person. Help this one with cash, that one with credit, another with influence, another with advice, another with healthful teachings. Even wild beasts can perceive the care of their keepers. No animal is so beyond taming that nurture does not soften it and turn it toward love of that which nurtures. Lions’ mouths are pulled open by their trainers without harm, and food brings the elephant’s wildness to slavish obedience; constant effort of devoted care wins over even those creatures who have no understanding or appreciation of the gifts. Someone’s ungrateful for today’s good deed? He won’t be for tomorrow’s. He forgot both? A third will call back the memory of those that have slipped away.

Those who are quick to think they have wasted good deeds will in fact waste them. But those who lean in, and add new good deeds to the first ones, will squeeze out gratitude from even a hard and oblivious heart. The beneficiaries won’t dare to lift their eyes in the face of so many good deeds; wherever they turn to escape their awareness, let them see you standing there. Besiege them with benefits.

\[1.5\] I must now explain the first of the things we have to learn—namely, what it is that we owe when someone’s given to us. Some think they owe the money they’ve received; others, the political office; others, the priesthood; others, the province. But these are only the markers of giving, not the gifts themselves. Gifts and good deeds can’t be touched by the hand; they’re enacted in the mind. Between the product of giving and the gift itself lies a huge gulf. The gift is not the gold, or the silver, or any of those things we think most important; it’s the very intent of the one who gives.

It’s the ignorant who take note only of those things that meet their eyes, that can be passed down and owned, while giving little weight to that which is in fact dear and precious. The things we hold in our hands and see with our eyes, the things our desire fastens on, are frail; both Fortune and human wrongs can take them away. But a gift or good deed endures, even after the object, the vehicle through which it was given,5 has perished. It’s a virtuous act. No power can render it meaningless.

\[1.6\] What then are gifts and good deeds? They’re generous acts, done in an eager and voluntary spirit, that bring joy, and also reap joy, from the act of giving. It doesn’t matter what’s done or given, but the attitude, since the gift is not the thing done or given, but lies in the heart of the one who does or gives. You can understand the huge difference between these things from this: A gift or good deed is certainly *good*, but the *thing* that’s given or done is neither good nor bad. It’s the heart that elevates little things, brightens dingy things, or casts into dishonor what’s thought to be great and valuable. The objects of our yearning are in themselves neutral, neither good nor bad in essence. It matters in what direction the Guiding Principle, from which things take their form, directs them. The gift is not the thing counted or handed over, just as it’s not the sacrificial animals, even if they’re fat and gleaming with gold, that form the honor paid to the gods, but rather the righteous and pious intent of worshipers. The good fulfill religious duties with grain or a bowl of meal; the bad cannot flee impiety, though they spill buckets of blood on the altars with their sacrifices.

If gifts and good deeds consisted in *things* rather than in the *intent* to do them, they’d be greater in proportion to the size of what we receive. But it’s not so. Often the ones who put us more in their debt are those who gave little but with a great spirit, who “in their heart made their wealth like that of kings,”6 who handed out a small amount but did so gladly, who forgot their own poverty while showing concern for mine, who had not only the intention but the *desire* to lend help, who felt that they *got* a gift when they gave one, who gave it with no thought of ever getting it back, or who got it back with no thought of ever having given it, who both sought out, then grabbed, the chance to help. Conversely, those “gifts” are in fact ungenerous, even if they seem great in appearance and substance, if they were either wrung from the givers or dropped thoughtlessly. More welcome by far is what comes not from a full but a willing hand. “*They* gave me only a little, but they were not able to give more. What *he* gave was huge, but he took his time, delayed, and when he gave, he sighed; he gave it in a superior manner, he spread the word of his gift, and did not seek to please the one to whom he gave. His gift was not to me, but to his own ostentation.”

\[1.11\] Let’s take this topic next: What gifts should be given, and how? First, let’s give what’s needed; then, what’s useful; third, what’s pleasing, especially things that will endure. We must begin however with what’s needed, for we conceive differently of things that preserve life than of those that embellish it or provide for it. Things that we can easily do without, we can size up with a discriminating eye, and can say about them: “Take it back, I don’t want it; I’m content with what I have.” \(Sometimes it’s pleasing not only to give back but also to toss far from you the things you’ve received.\)

From the things that are necessary, top priority goes to those without which we *can’t* live; second, to those without which we *ought not*; third, \[to\] those without which we *wouldn’t want to*. The first category includes things of this sort: being rescued from the hands of enemies, or from the wrath of a despot, or from proscription,7 or from other dangers, varied and obscure, that assail human life. \[1.11.4\] The second includes things without which we *can* survive, but in such a way that death would be preferable, such as freedom, virtue, and a sound mind. Next are the things that we hold dear by reason of closeness, blood relation, familiarity, and long-standing custom, such as children, spouses, household gods, and other things to which the heart is so attached that we’d regard it as more grave to be separated from these than from life.

Next come the useful things, diverse and wide-ranging in their content. Here we’ll place money—not in excess, but enough for a healthful way of life; here, honor, and advancement toward higher station \(for those who strive in that direction\), since nothing is more useful than to become useful to oneself.

The gifts and good deeds that remain come out of an overflowing prosperity, such as makes people spoiled. In this category, we’ll seek to make our gifts pleasing by timely presentation and by avoiding the commonplace, by giving things that few people own \(few at least in this era or in this manner\), or things that may not be precious in themselves but become so because of the time, or place, they were given.

We should think about what we can give that will bring most pleasure in future, what the owners will often bump into so that we’ll be in their thoughts every time they’re in its presence. We’ll at least be careful not to send any useless gifts, such as hunting gear to a woman8 or an old man, or books to a simpleton, or nets9 to a scholar immersed in studies. On the other hand, we’ll take equal care, if we want to send pleasing things, not to send something that will rebuke a person’s failings, such as wine to a drunkard, or medicines to the sickly. If it acknowledges a vice of the recipient, it starts to be a curse and not a gift.

*In the second book of* On Benefits*, Seneca expands on the point made in book 1, that the attitude with which one gives is far more important than the gift itself. He extends this idea to include receiving as well as giving, commencing a long inquiry, continuing throughout the work, into the importance of gratitude.*

\[2.1\] Let us give in the same spirit with which we would want to receive—above all, generously, promptly, with no hesitation.

There’s no gratitude incurred by a gift that sticks for a long time to the hands of the giver, or that someone seems pained to let go of and gives as if tearing it away. Even if some delay intervenes, let’s by all means avoid seeming to think things over. The one who hesitates is nearly refusing, and does not earn any gratitude. Since the intention of the person giving is the most pleasant part of the gift, and since the giver reveals by hesitation an unwillingness to give, he didn’t make a gift so much as lose a battle with someone drawing it out of him. Many indeed are generous only when weakness makes them submissive.

It’s the gifts and good deeds standing in readiness that are most pleasing, the easy and voluntary ones, where no delay is seen except through the modesty of the receiver. It’s best to anticipate what each person wants; next best, to gratify the desire. It’s better to go right ahead and not wait to be asked. Righteous people purse their lips and blush all over in order to make a request; whoever spares them this travail multiplies the good deed. \[2.2\] The words “I ask” are vexing and burdensome, to be spoken with a downcast face. A friend, or whomever you will make your friend by doing a good turn, must be relieved of having to say them. However fast we move, we give too late if we give on request.

\[2.4\] But there are many who drag their giving into hatefulness by the harshness of their words and their arrogance, employing such speech and such contempt that we regret obtaining our object. The thing is promised, and then delays intervene. Nothing is more unpleasant than when what you’ve “gotten” has to be asked for. Gifts and good deeds should be given and done on the spot; some find it’s harder to get hold of them in fact than in promise. A third party must be sought to send a reminder and a fourth to close the deal. Thus, a single gift gets worn away as it passes through many hands. As a result, the one who made the promise gets only a tiny portion of gratitude, since each intermediary takes a cut. If you want your gifts to be appreciated, take care of this: that they pass whole and undiminished to those to whom you’ve promised, without any commission \(so to speak\) taken out.

\[2.5\] Nothing is so bitter as to be kept dangling a long time. Some can more easily endure having their hopes dashed than having them drawn out at length. Yet many share this fault—postponement of promises—through their warped aspiration of having a huge crowd of petitioners. That’s how the attendants of royal power behave,10 those who delight in long demonstrations of superiority; they think they have less power if they don’t display that power to each person in turn, often and at length. They do nothing promptly or conclusively; they harm at top speed but benefit slowly. \[2.5.2\] That’s where we get those shouts voiced by righteous anger: “Do it already, if you’re doing anything\!” and “Nothing is worth *this*; I’d rather you said no\!” When the heart, fatigued, begins to hate the good turn it waits for, can it ever feel gratitude?

\[2.5.4\] All generosity is speedy. It’s natural to one who does something gladly to do it quickly. Whoever gives aid slowly, dragging it out from one day to the next, doesn’t give it from the heart. That person loses the two greatest things, time, and the demonstration of friendly intent. Wanting slowly is the sign of not wanting.

*Seneca often cites quips or anecdotes from historical figures to make his points, as in the following passage, where he invokes Fabius Maximus \(here called Fabius Verrucosus\), a hero of Rome’s wars against Carthage \(centuries before his own time\).*

\[2.6.2\] How sweet and precious is the gift given by one who won’t allow any thanks, or who forgets, even as he gives, that he has given\! But to carp at a person just as you give something is madness; it mixes reproach with kindness. Gifts and good deeds must not be made bitter or mixed with anything unpleasant. Choose a different occasion if there’s anything you want to reprove. Fabius Verrucosus used to compare a gift given in harsh manner by a stern donor to a loaf of bread with stone grit in it; if one is starving, one must accept it, but it’s a bitter meal.

*Seneca’s ethical code demands that the giver abandon all thought of gain, including, as explained in the following, any public acknowledgment of the gift. Seneca would greatly approve the custom of modern-day philanthropists who have their gifts attributed to “anonymous.”*

\[2.10\] Sometimes those being helped must even be deceived, so that they’re not able to know from whom they benefited. It is said that Arcesilaus11 thought it best to give aid in secret to his friend, a poor man who concealed his poverty, who was moreover ill but did not admit this either, who lacked the means to pay for his needs. Arcesilaus snuck a small purse under the man’s pillow without his knowledge. That way the man, who was so pointlessly self-effacing, might *find* what he needed rather than receive it. “*What?*” you ask. “He won’t know from whom he got it?” Yes, let him not know, if not knowing is part of the gift he receives. Then I’ll do much else, I’ll give much, so that from those other deeds he’ll understand who did the first one. In the end, *he* won’t know he got something, but *I’ll* know that I gave.

“That’s not enough,” you say. No, it’s not, if you plan to *lend at interest*. If you plan to *give*, then you’ll give, in whatever way will most benefit the one who receives. You’ll be content to have *yourself* as a witness. Otherwise, it’s not good deeds that gratify you but the appearance of doing them. “But I want him to know, at least\!” You’re seeking a debtor. “I want him at least to know\!” What’s that? If it’s better for him not to know, more honorable and more gracious, won’t you change your opinion? “I want him to know\!” So then, you won’t save a man in the dark?

Of course, when occasion allows, we must have regard for the joy that comes from the eagerness of the recipient; I don’t deny that. But if our assistance brings shame despite being called for, if our assistance offends unless concealed, then I won’t publish my gift or good deed in the newspapers.12 Of course not\! I’m not going to let on that I was the giver. It’s a teaching of prime importance and greatest necessity that I must not make reproaches or even reminders. Between two partners in giving, there is this law: The one should forget right away the giving of a gift, the other should never forget receiving it.

Frequent mention of our good deeds wounds and oppresses the heart. It makes people want to shout, like the man saved from the triumvirs’ proscription13 by a certain friend of Caesar, when he could no longer bear his rescuer’s arrogance: “Give me back to Caesar\!” For how long will you keep saying, “I’m the one who saved you, I snatched you from doom\!”? If I remember it on my own account, it’s life you gave; if on yours, it’s death. I owe you nothing, if you only saved me to have someone to show off. For how long will you exhibit me? For how long will you prevent me from forgetting my bad luck? In a triumphal parade, I would only have marched a single time\!14 There should be no talk of what we have given. Those who give reminders are looking to be paid back. Don’t harp on it, don’t call it back to mind—unless you evoke an earlier gift by making a new one\!

We shouldn’t even tell *others*. Let the one who *gave* keep quiet; the one who *got* should tell. Or else you’ll be told what was said to that man who always bragged of what he gave. “You can’t say you didn’t get it back\!” said the one who received it. “When?” “Often enough, and in many places: Wherever and whenever you described it\!” Why do you need to speak of it, to take over the other person’s job? There’s someone who can do this more honorably, and whose narration will offer this new cause for praise: the fact that *you*’re not narrating. You’re taking me for an ingrate if, in your eyes, no one will know of your gift unless you tell them\!

\[2.11.4\] Total humaneness must accompany our gifts. A farmer will lose his crop if he only sows the seed and then stops work. It takes lots of effort to bring what is sown into ripeness. Nothing comes to fruition unless continuously cared for from its first stage to its last. It’s the same with gifts and good deeds. Can there be among these anything greater than the things a father gives to his children? Yet these lead nowhere if they cease in infancy, if an enduring sense of duty does not nourish the initial gift. Other gifts follow the same rule: If you don’t support them, you’ll lose them. It’s not enough to have given; you must nurture them too. If you want to make your debtors grateful, you must not only give but love what you give as well.

Most of all, as I’ve said, let’s go easy on people’s ears. Reminders give rise to irritation; reproaches, to hatred. A superior attitude in giving must be avoided above all. What need of an arrogant face or puffed-up speech? The act itself elevates you. Away with vain display. Our deeds will speak while we keep silent. A gift given in a superior way incurs not only ingratitude but dislike too.

\[2.13\] Haughty pride\! Most foolish of great Fortune’s evils\! How pleasing if we get nothing from you\! How you turn every gift, every good deed, into injury\! How badly all things reflect on you\! The higher you raise yourself, the lower you sink. You show that you were not entitled to claim those good things that make you so puffed up. Whatever you give, you ruin. I’d like to ask why pride sticks its nose in the air, why it so distorts its features and expression as to prefer a mask to a face? It’s the things given with human visage, gentle and calm, that please, things that one higher than me did not hold over my head when giving, but rather stayed as kind as he could, came down to my level, stripped all ceremony away from his gift. \[2.13.3\] The only way to convince people not to let arrogance destroy their giving is to show them that the “greatness” of haughty pride is an empty sham. It diverts onto the path of hatred things that ought to be loved.

Some things though will cause harm to those who obtain them. In that case, it’s a good deed *not* to give them, but indeed to refuse them. We will need to assess what is useful for those who ask, rather than what is desired. Often, we yearn for harmful things, and we’re not able to discern how dangerous they are, since emotion gets in the way of judgment. But when yearning has subsided, when that impulse of a soul on fire, which drives out better counsel, has retreated, we hate those who sponsored our evil gifts and caused us harm. Just as we refuse chilled water15 to the sick, blades to those who are grief-stricken or enraged at themselves, and to the insane anything that their passion for self-destruction seeks, so we will persist in saying no to those who ask sincerely and humbly, sometimes even piteously, for things that will cause them harm. It’s proper to look not just to the starting points of the benefits, but to the endpoints, and to give things that will please them not just at the moment they get them, but long afterward.

Many people would say: “I know this won’t help him, but what can I do? He’s asking, and I can’t resist his entreaties. It’s *his* problem. He’ll have himself to blame, not me.” That’s wrong. He’ll blame you, and deservedly. When he returns to his right mind, when that passion that fired his brain has retreated, why wouldn’t he hate the one who helped him along toward his own loss and peril? You’d bestow a cruel kindness by destroying those whose wishes you grant. Just as it’s the most noble deed to save the lives even of those who don’t want to be saved, so it’s a kind of hatred, though a smooth and courteous one, to lavish poisons on those who seek them. Let’s give gifts that will continue to please as long as they’re in use, that will never turn into something bad. I won’t give money that I know will end up in the purse of an adulteress, nor will I join the company of those doing or planning wrong. If I can, I’ll pull these people back from their crimes, or if not, at the least I won’t help them.

\[2.15.3\] Each of us must consider our own resources and means, lest we give more, or less, than we’re able. Also, the quality of the person to whom we give must be examined. Some gifts are smaller than ought to issue from great people, while others are too large for the receiver. Compare the nature of both giver and receiver, and assess too the gift you will give, asking whether it’s too large or too small for the giver, and also whether the one on the receiving end will either disdain it or refuse to accept it.

Alexander the Great—a madman, whose mind conceived only on an enormous scale—was about to give a *city* to someone. When the man to whom he was giving it took his own measure and rejected the gift on the grounds that it would spur envy, saying it did not consort with his station, Alexander replied: “I’m not asking what’s fitting for you to get, but what’s fitting for me to give.” This seems to show spirit and royal bearing, though in fact it’s very stupid. Nothing is in itself a fitting gift for anyone. What matters is who gives it and to whom, where, why, when, and the other factors without which one cannot make a true accounting of the deed. Alexander—you most puffed-up of all creatures\! \[2.16.2\] Grant that you *could* do this, that Fortune had so far elevated you that cities were your bequests \(but how much greater the mind that would have refrained from seizing them, rather than from squandering them\!\); nonetheless, some people are too small for their pockets to contain a city\!

A Cynic wise man once asked King Antigonus for a talent of silver.16 The king replied that this was more than a Cynic ought to request. Rebuffed, the man asked for a single denarius. Antigonus replied that this was less than a king ought to give. “But,” you say, “sophistry of that type is most ignoble. The king merely found a way to meet neither request. He considered the kingly role in the matter of the denarius, the Cynic role in that of the talent; he might have given a denarius to the man as a Cynic, and bestowed a talent in his own place as king. Though some gifts might be too large for a Cynic to receive, there’s nothing so small that the generosity of a king might not give it with honor.” If you want my opinion, though, I approve the king’s replies. It’s insupportable for someone who hates money to also ask for it. You’ve proclaimed a hatred of money; this is your creed, you’ve adopted this role; you must see it through. It’s outrageous for you to get rich under a guise of noble poverty.17 One must look to one’s own role in life not less than to that of the person one wants to help.

\[2.17.3\] I’ll use a comparison drawn from our Chrysippus,18 concerning a game of ball. If the ball falls to the ground, clearly either the thrower or the catcher is at fault. It stays on course when, as it passes through the hands of both, it’s skillfully thrown and caught by both. But a good ballplayer must throw differently depending on whether the other player is tall or short. It’s the same with gifts and good deeds. Unless they’re fitted to both characters, that of the giver and receiver, they won’t leave the hands of one, or arrive in those of the other, as they should. If our exchange is with a skilled and trained partner, we’ll throw the ball more boldly; however it travels, a skilled and unencumbered hand will return it. But if our partner is new to the game and *un*trained, we won’t throw so stiffly or so strongly but more gently, running forward to direct the ball in a relaxed way into his very hand. The same must be done in the case of gifts and good deeds. We ought to be teachers some of the time, and deem it sufficient if our students make an effort, or take a chance, or show their willingness. Rather, we make others ungrateful, or encourage them when they are so, as though our gifts would be great only if adequate thanks were not possible\!

\[2.17.6\] There are many, the arrogant and the self-congratulating, whose natures are so warped that they’d rather lose what they’ve given than be seen taking repayment. How much better, how much more humane, to let recipients too play their parts, to nurture their means of showing gratitude, to put a good interpretation on everything, to hear expressions of thanks as though they were repayments, and to show such a lack of concern as to want the debtor to be released from obligation\! The moneylender who makes harsh demands on clients gets a bad reputation, as does the one who’s slow to accept payoffs and stubbornly finds reasons to delay. But gifts are different; repaying them is just as crucial as not demanding repayment. The best sort of person gives freely, never makes demands, is delighted by returns, forgets what was given \(honestly and truly\), and takes payback in the spirit of one accepting a gift.

*Having covered many aspects of giving, Seneca turns also to the topic of how one should receive gifts.*

\[2.18.1\] Now let’s pass over to the other side of our topic—namely, how people ought to behave when they accept gifts or good deeds.

\[2.18.2\] The first lesson Reason offers is that we must not accept them from everyone. From whom then? Let me reply in brief: from those to whom we would have given. Let’s look carefully, for it takes greater discernment to find a creditor than a borrower. Besides other problems \(for many indeed arise\), it’s a serious torment to owe someone you don’t want to owe. On the other hand, it’s most pleasant to accept a good turn from those whom you’d be able to adore even after they did you wrong. \[2.18.5\] I need to choose whom to receive a boon from, and I need to choose the lender of a boon more carefully than a lender of money. To the moneylender I need only pay back what I borrowed, and once I’ve done that, I’m free and clear. But to the giver of a boon I must give back even more, and once I’ve done so, we remain connected nonetheless.

\[2.22\] Once we’ve made the choice to accept, we should do so cheerfully, expressing our joy in a way that the givers can’t miss, so they’ll get an immediate reward. It’s a righteous source of happiness to see a friend made happy, and even more righteous to have made him so. \[2.23\] But some prefer not to accept a gift unless in secret; they avoid having anyone witness or know what’s going on. These, you must know, have the wrong frame of mind. . . . Don’t accept what you’re embarrassed to owe\! Some people give thanks on the sly, in a corner, whispering in the ear. This isn’t shyness, but a kind of rejection. It’s ungrateful to give thanks only after witnesses have left the room.

\[2.24.2\] We must not accept in a fussy way, nor abjectly and humbly; for if someone accepts indifferently, though the whole benefit stands newly before his eyes, what will he do after that initial delight has grown cold? Some people accept haughtily, saying: “I don’t need it, but since you’re so eager, I’ll go along with your wishes.” Others accept passively, so as to leave the giver in doubt as to whether they even perceived it. Still others barely open their mouths, behaving less gratefully than if they’d just kept silent.

The intensity of our thanks should match the scale of the gift. Things like this should be added: “You’ve made more people than you know beholden to you” \(for everyone rejoices in a benefit that is known far and wide\); “You don’t know what you’ve given me, but you ought to know how much more it is than you imagine” \(those who put themselves in debt show their gratitude straight off\); “I’ll never be able to repay you; but I won’t stop proclaiming everywhere that I can’t repay you.” \[2.25.2\] Let’s use these words and others like them, so our intention won’t be hidden but radiant and open. The words may come up short, but if we’re moved in the way we ought to be, our awareness will show in our faces.

*Seneca is deeply concerned in* On Benefits *with ingratitude, a failing that, he argues at one point, threatens the very fabric of society. He debates at length \(in a section not included here\) whether ingratitude should be considered a crime and punished accordingly, ultimately deciding it should not be. In the following sections, he analyzes the causes of ingratitude, then moves to a consideration of the gratitude we all owe, as human beings, to Nature and to the gods.*

\[2.26\] Now, we must examine what it is that mostly makes people ungrateful. What makes them so is either too great regard for the self, and the flaw entrenched in the mortal condition—admiring oneself and one’s deeds; or, greediness; or, jealousy. Let’s begin with the first of these causes.

All people judge themselves generously. That leads them to believe that they deserve everything, to accept gifts as though receiving payments, and to consider their worth undervalued. “He gave me this,” they say, “but how tardily, after how many travails\! How much more I could have attained, had I preferred the patronage of *him*, or *him*, or my own\! I hadn’t looked for this: I’ve been tossed in with the common herd. Does he think me worth so little? It would have been more honorable had I been ignored.”

\[2.27.3\] Second, it’s greed that prevents people from feeling grateful. What’s been given never lives up to our wanton hopes. We want more the more has come our way. Greed becomes much more virulent when focused on collecting great wealth, just as the strength of a flame becomes immeasurably fiercer, the greater the blaze from which it leaps forth.

Similarly, ambition won’t let us rest content with our quantity of honors, even if that amount meets what we once, immodestly, wished for. We give no thanks for a tribuneship, but instead complain that we weren’t advanced to the praetorship; and this won’t do, if there’s no consulship; and not even a consulship satisfies, if there’s only *one*.19 Greed keeps reaching ever farther, not comprehending its own happiness, since it looks only to where it’s heading, not where it came from.

\[2.28\] Then there’s jealousy, an evil more powerful and insistent than all these. It deranges us with comparisons: “He gave to me, but gave *more* to *him*, and gave *sooner* to *him*.” Jealousy never speaks on behalf of another, but promotes its own cause ahead of all. How much simpler and more sensible to mentally enlarge the gift that was received, on the understanding that we are not valued as highly by others as by ourselves. “I should have gotten more, but it wasn’t easy for him to give more; his generosity had to be channeled in many directions; this is just a start, so let’s be of good cheer and, by accepting this gratefully, let’s call forth his better nature; he did too little, but there are more occasions ahead; he advanced *that* one ahead of me, but me ahead of many; *that* one does not come up to my level in virtues or in services, but he has his own charms; I won’t get to a place of deserving greater things if I complain, but rather, I’ll seem *un*deserving of what’s been given. So he gave more to *those* worthless people, so what? Fortune rarely acts the judge\! We complain every day that evil men are fortunate; often a hailstorm passes over the garden plots of the worst sort of people, and smashes the crops of the best; each of us endures our own destiny, in friendship as in other things.” There’s no gift so generous that ill-will can’t tear it down, and there’s none so tiny that a generous interpreter can’t make it bigger. You’ll never lack reasons to complain if you examine gifts with a jaundiced eye.

Just look\! How even those who claim wisdom are unfair assessors of the gifts of the gods. They complain that we’re bested by elephants in size of our bodies, by deer in swiftness, by birds in lightness, by bulls in forcefulness; that wild animals have thick hides—the deer’s more lovely, the bear’s shaggier, the beaver’s softer; that dogs surpass us in keenness of scent, eagles in sharpness of sight, crows in lifespan, and many animals in the ability to swim. And they call it an injury that humankind is not made up of various and incompatible virtues \(even though Nature does not permit certain qualities to co-exist in the same creature, such as speed and physical strength\), and they say the gods neglect us because they didn’t give us good health that can’t be damaged by our bad behaviors, or knowledge of the future. They barely refrain from going to such a pitch of insolence that they come to hate Nature, because we’re lower than the gods, because we don’t stand on their level. How much more gratifying to turn to the contemplation of so many and such great gifts, and to give thanks, that the gods wanted us to have second place to theirs in this most beautiful dwelling place, that they put us in charge of the world\! Is there any comparison between us and those animals over which we have complete power? Whatever has been denied to us was something that *couldn’t* be given.

Whoever you are who so unfairly assess the lot of humanity: Consider how many gifts our parent20 has given us, how much more powerful than us are the creatures we have put under the yoke, how much faster those we chase and catch, how there’s nothing that lives that we can’t subdue with might. We’ve received so many strengths, so many crafts, and ultimately, the mind, which can journey to any place it aims in a moment, which is swifter than the stars—indeed it runs on ahead of the courses those stars will follow ages later; so many fruits, so much wealth, such a store of other resources heaped up on top of still others. Go ahead, look around everywhere, take the individual attributes from all creatures that you’d wish had been given to you; you won’t find anything you’d rather be. If you rightly assess the kindness of Nature, you must admit that you’re the apple of her eye.

Here’s the story: The immortal gods have held us most dear, and continue to do so. They have made us closest in station to themselves, the greatest honor that could be bestowed. We’ve gotten great things; we couldn’t manage greater.

I thought this message was needed, both because I had to speak a bit about the greatest benefits when discussing the smallest ones, and because the arrogance of this hateful vice, ingratitude, spreads into other arenas. To whom will those who scorn the highest gifts reply gratefully? What gift will they consider great or needful of recompense? In whose debt will they be for health or breath if they deny that their life is a gift from the gods, a gift they requisition every day?

Whoever teaches people to be grateful helps the causes of both humans and gods—the gods, who need nothing and who stand outside all desire, yet we can still render them our thanks. There’s no reason for anyone to use weakness or lack of resources to excuse an ungrateful mind, or to say: “What am I to do, and how to do it? When am I to return thanks to those higher beings, the lords of all things?” It’s easy to return a good deed. If you’re greedy, you can do it without expense; if you’re lazy, without effort: at the very instant you become obligated, if you wish it, you’ll have paid back any donor on equal terms. Whoever cheerfully accepts a gift or good deed, thereby returns it.

\[2.33\] Someone’s done me a good turn. I received it just as he wanted me to do. So he’s got what he sought, the *only* thing he sought, and so I’m grateful. Beyond this, he might get some advantage from me, something useful that comes from a grateful person, but this is not the remaining part of an incomplete duty—rather, it’s an extension beyond what’s already complete. If Phidias21 makes a statue, he gets one kind of profit from his art, another from what that art produces. His art lies in making what he wants; the product lies in making it for profit. Phidias has completed his work even if he did not sell it.

\[2.34\] “What then?” you say. “Has a person who does *nothing* shown gratitude?” That person did the most important thing: With his good attitude he did me a good turn, and did it on an equal footing, as befits friendship. Then too, there’s the fact that a benefit and a loan are repaid differently. There’s no need to expect me to display my repayment before you. The thing takes place between our minds.

\[2.35.3\] “Good things have been given to me, my good name has been protected, my ill-repute has been removed, my life has been saved, along with my freedom, which is more precious than life. And how will I be able to show my gratitude? When will that day arrive, on which I can reveal to him my heart?” That day is here—the one on which he showed you his\! Accept the good turn, embrace it, be glad—not because you’re getting it, but because you’re returning it, though you still will owe it. That way you won’t run the risk of this great mischance: a turn of events might make you ungrateful.

What I suggest is nothing difficult; I don’t want you to lose heart or grow weary from anticipating great efforts and long servitude. I’m not postponing your task to the future; it’s about the here and now. You’ll never be grateful if you are not grateful at once.

What will you do? Not take up weapons, though maybe someday that will be needed. Not cross the oceans, though maybe someday you’ll sail before menacing winds. You want to repay a good turn? Accept it with kindness. You’ve shown gratitude, not so that you’ll think you’re free of debt, but so that your debt will be more free of worries.

*In book 3, Seneca continues his discussion of ingratitude, what causes it and how to combat it. After deciding it cannot be criminalized, he comes to the conclusion that ingrates punish themselves by cutting themselves off from the joy of generosity.*

\[3.1.3\] Ingrates come in many varieties, just as thieves and murderers do; they share one crime, but there’s a great range of types. They’re ingrates if they deny that they got a gift; ingrates, if they conceal it; ingrates, if they make no return; the worst ingrates of all, if they forget. The ones who don’t repay at least still acknowledge the debt, and surely they retain some trace of the good deeds done for them, buried within their bad conscience; they might be turned back toward a show of gratitude by some cause or other, if shame spurs them on or the sudden impulse toward honorable behavior \(the kind of thing that arises now and then even in evil hearts\), or if a ready opportunity beckons. But the other sort can never become grateful, once the benefit they received has completely slipped away.

Which would you call worse: the one who feels no gratitude for a good deed, or the one who has no memory of it? It’s sickly eyes that shrink from daylight, but blind ones that don’t perceive it. Not to love one’s parents is impious, but to fail to recognize them—insane\! \[3.2.2\] To repay a favor requires moral strength, time, resources, and the blessings of Fortune. But to *remember* it makes a person grateful enough, even without expense. Remembering requires no effort, nor wealth, nor success, so those who don’t do it have no excuse to hide behind.

\[3.3\] There are other factors that strip good deeds, sometimes even very great ones, from our minds, but the foremost and most influential is that we’re preoccupied by fresh desires and look to what we want, not what we have. Reaching out for the next acquisition makes the one in your home seem worthless. It follows that, if desire for new things makes what you’ve gotten seem trivial, the one who helped you get it won’t be appreciated. We adore and admire our benefactors, and declare that our entire condition is due to them, so long as the things we sought continue to please us. But then, the dazzle of *other* things bursts into our hearts, and our impulses rush toward *them*, in the way that people tend to move from great desires to even greater ones. Whatever we earlier called a gift or good deed gets immediately struck out of the record; we don’t look at the things that set us above other people, but only at the display Fortune makes in those who stand higher than we do.

No one can be both jealous and grateful at the same time. Jealousy belongs to the bitter and discontented, gratitude to the joyous. Then too, there’s the fact that all of us know only the moment that rushes past before us; only rarely do we turn our minds backward toward the past. Thus, our teachers, and the benefits they conferred, pass out of our minds once we have left childhood behind; thus, the things that nurtured our adolescence die away, for *that* stage of life never returns. We all file away that which *was*, not under “past,” but under “gone forever,” and memory grows feeble in those always bent on what’s to come.

\[3.17\] “What then?” you ask. “Will the ingrates go unpunished?” What indeed, I reply—Shall the irreverent go unpunished? The ill-tempered? The greedy? The reckless? The cruel? Do you really think that qualities we detest go unpunished, or do you judge any punishment more weighty than public hatred? *This* is punishment: not to dare to accept a gift or good deed from anyone, not to dare to give one, to be marked out by the eyes of all or to think oneself so marked out, to lose the apprehension of the best and sweetest thing. Or do you call someone unhappy who’s lost keenness of sight, or whose ears are blocked by infirmity, but not call wretched those who have lost the sensation of giving? They live in fear of the gods, who are witnesses of every ingratitude. The awareness of the giving from which they’re barred burns and chokes them. This punishment is great enough: not to taste the fruit of what, as I’ve said, is sweetest of all.

*In book 4 of* On Benefits, *Seneca moves to the moral heart of his topic, the relationship between human generosity and the beneficence of the gods. As a Stoic, Seneca subscribed to the view that the gods—not conceived of primarily as Jupiter and his family, but as diffuse, amorphous beings or a single collective being \(see 4.7\)—are entirely benevolent, to the extent \(not a very great one\) they even care about human life. They are the forces that first set the cosmos in order and continue to keep it running smoothly. Because the world they have established holds many boons for humankind, Seneca regards them as models of selfless giving. This view is partly based on his dismissal \(see 4.25\) of the traditional notion that the gods delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices.*

\[4.1\] Out of all the things we’ve taken up, Aebutius Liberalis, nothing can be thought more essential or more needful of careful expression \(as Sallust says\) than what is now before us: the question of whether giving a boon, and returning a favor in turn, should be pursued simply for its own sake.

We see some people who attend to honorable things only for the sake of gain, and who take no pleasure in virtue if it has no price tag—virtue, which has no trace of magnificence if it’s something to be bought and sold. What’s baser than for someone to count up how much a good man is worth, since virtue neither draws us on with gain nor scares us off with loss? . . . We must go toward her by treading expedience underfoot, and go wherever she calls or sends us, without looking to our own household, without any sparing of our blood; her power must never be disparaged. “What will I get then,” you say, “if I do this bravely and graciously?” Only this: the fact that you did it. Nothing else is promised to you.

\[4.3.2\] It’s not a gift or good deed if it looks toward an increase of fortune. Besides, if only expedience prompted us to help others, then those who can most easily do so would give least of all—the wealthy, the powerful, the monarchs, those who don’t need help from others. Not even the *gods* would bestow so many gifts, which in fact they heap on us day and night without ceasing. For their own nature suffices for all their needs, and renders them complete, and safe, beyond all harm. They will give nothing good to anyone, if the only reason for giving is to look out for oneself and one’s advantage. To look not for where you can best place your boon, but where you will get the most profit from it, and where you will most easily reap the reward—this is not giving, but investing.

\[4.4.3\] Who is so wretched and cast down, who so accursed by fate and born for trouble, as not to perceive the greatness of the generosity of the gods? Look around at those whiners who are always bemoaning their fortunes, and still you won’t find a one who has no share of heaven’s benefactions, no one who has not been touched by a drop from that kindliest of springs. Was it too little, then—that which was parceled out to us at birth on an equal basis? Never mind the goods that were later divided in uneven measure. Did Nature give too little when she gave us *herself*?

\[4.5\] “But god doesn’t give gifts or do good deeds,”22 you object. Then from where came those things you own, give, cling to, treasure, or steal? From where those countless delights of your eyes, ears, and mind? From where that bounty that furnishes our luxury—for we are not just provided with our needs, but loved as though we were sweethearts? So many trees, with their various fruits; so many medicinal plants; so many foodstuffs spread through each season, such that earth brings forth nurture at random for even the idler? Creatures of every species, some on dry, solid ground, some swimming in waters, some dropping through the firmament, so that every region of the natural world may pay us some tribute? Rivers that in one spot enfold the fields with most pleasant meanders, in another roll in a broad and navigable course that makes a road for trade? And among these, the ones that swell wondrously in summertime, such that a sudden rush of summer torrent irrigates the places exposed to burning skies? And what of the springs of healing waters? And the upsurge of warm currents upon our very shores?

\[4.6\] If someone were to give you a few acres, you’d say you had received a gift. Yet you refuse to call a gift the vast expanse of the earth’s lands, stretching out far and wide? If someone gives you money and—since you think this a big deal—fills your coin-chest, you’ll call it a boon. But god has placed so many precious metals, has drawn so many rivers from the ground, bearing gold as they flow through the soil; silver, copper, and iron, huge masses of them, buried in all places, and god has given you the ability to seek them out, and placed on earth’s surface the marks of the riches hidden beneath—yet you deny you’ve received a boon? If a house should be given to you, gleaming with marble, its ceiling shining with gold or spangled with colors,23 you’ll call it no ordinary favor. Yet god has built for you a huge dwelling, with no risk of fire or collapse, in which you’ll find, not cheap stone veneer, thinner than the saw-blade that cut it, but solid blocks of the most costly stone, and all of them variegated and complex, so that even a tiny piece inspires your awe, and a ceiling that glitters differently by night and by day—then do you deny you’ve received a favor? And though you place great value on these things you have, do you play the ingrate and suppose you are in no one’s debt? From where came this breath that you draw? From where this light by which you order and arrange the acts of your life? From where the blood that sustains the warmth of life with its flow? From where those foods that excite your palate with rare flavors, though you’re already full? From where those goads to worn-out pleasure-seeking? From where the quietude in which you languish and rot? Won’t you say, if you know gratitude, *A god made this tranquility for us*?24

It’s indeed a god, who has loosed not just a few cows, but vast herds, through the whole world, who provides fodder for the flocks as they roam everywhere, who has replaced summer pasturage with that of winter, who has taught not only the music of the pipe, and the shaping of rude and untrained song to some small measure of form, but has devised so many arts, such variety of vocal expression, so many sounds producing music. . . . You must not call these things we’ve invented “ours,” any more than you can call “ours” the fact that we grow.

\[4.7\] “But it’s nature that bestows these things on us,” someone says. Don’t you realize that when you say this, you’re merely swapping that name for “god”? For what else is Nature but god and divine reason, spread through the whole universe and all its parts? Whenever you wish, you can address the author of all our reality in some other way; you’ll be right to use the names “Jupiter” and “the Thunderer” and “the Supporter.” . . . Even if you use the name “Fate,” you won’t be off the mark, for Fate is only a connected sequence of causation, and god is the first cause of all things, on which other causes depend. Whatever names you choose, you’ll be right to apply them to this being if they convey a certain power and achievement of heavenly things. There can be as many names as the gifts that are bestowed.

\[4.9\] God gives us very many and very great gifts, without expectation of repayment, since god does not need a gift from us, nor can we give anything to god. Giving is something to be sought for its own sake. All that is looked for in it is the gain of the one who receives. Let’s move toward this, and put our own advantage aside.

“You claim,” someone objects, “that we must carefully select those for whom we do good turns. . . . And what’s more, you ask where and in what manner one ought to do them—something you would not need to ask, if doing good turns was a thing to be sought for its own sake. It’s a good turn no matter where and in what manner it’s done.” I answer: We seek honor for no other reason than for honor itself; yet, even if nothing else is sought, we still ask, what we ought to do and when and in what way. It’s these choices that constitute honor. Just so, when I choose for whom to do a good deed, I am making sure that my deed is in fact good. For if it’s done for some foul person, it’s neither a good deed nor an honor.

Returning a deposit is a thing to be sought for its own sake, yet I won’t return it on every occasion, nor in any place or time. Sometimes it doesn’t matter whether I withhold it or return it openly. I’ll look to the advantage of the person to whom I’m going to return it, and I’ll deny that person any deposit that will cause harm. I’ll do just the same with gifts and good deeds, examining when, to whom, how, and why I should give them. Nothing must be done unless by way of Reason. It’s not a benefit if it’s not given by way of Reason, for Reason accompanies every honorable deed.

How often have we heard this utterance from those condemning their own heedless gift: “I’d rather have lost it than given it to *them*\!” A heedless gift is the most ignoble sort of loss; it’s much more serious to have given badly than not to have gotten something back. The fault is another’s, if we get nothing back, but our own, if we give to someone we didn’t choose carefully. But in the choosing, I will look least of all to that which *you* expect—namely, from whom I shall get a return. I’ll choose the one who’s grateful, not the one who’ll give back. Often the one who won’t give back is grateful, while the one who did so is an ingrate. My assessment aims at quality of mind. I’ll pass over a rich but unworthy fellow, and give to a virtuous pauper. *That* one will still be grateful in the depths of need. Though all else be lacking, the quality of mind will endure.

I don’t seek money, nor pleasure, nor glory from doing good turns. Content to please *one* person, I’ll give for this reason: to do what I ought. But that “ought” is still subject to choice. What sort of choice will it be, you ask? I’ll choose sound people, straightforward, mindful, grateful; those who leave alone what belongs to another, and keep a light grasp on what’s theirs; those who wish others well. I’ll choose such people, and if Fortune grants them nothing from which they might return the favor, the thing will be accomplished—by their feelings.

If it’s advantage and base calculation that makes me generous, if I help no one except to get that person to help me, then I won’t give to those who set out for distant, diverse regions, since they’ll always be far off; I won’t give to one who’s so ill as to have no hope of recovery; I won’t give when I myself am failing, when I don’t have the time to get my own back. But, so that you’ll recognize the impulse to do good as a thing sought for its own sake: We help those from foreign lands who’ve arrived in our ports and are soon to depart again; we give, and fit out, a boat for the shipwrecked stranger, to get him back home. He leaves scarcely knowing who sponsored his recovery, and, though never to turn back again and come into our sight, he appoints the gods as our debtors and prays that they return the favor on his behalf. Meanwhile, we take joy in contemplating our good deed, though it had no reward.

What then? When we have arrived at the very end of life, when we’re setting out our last wills, do we not distribute gifts that will not help us in any way? How much time is used up, how much thought do we take in solitude over how much we should give, and to whom\! But what does it matter to whom we give, when we’ll get nothing back from anyone? Yet we never give more carefully, never twist and turn our decisions, than when honor alone stands before our eyes, all advantage stripped away. We are bad judges of our duties, so long as hope distorts them, and fear, and that most torpid of the vices, pleasure. When death has shut these out and has dispatched an incorruptible judge to pronounce sentence, we seek those most worthy to whom we may hand down our property; we make no arrangements more carefully and precisely, than those that have no bearing on *us*. By Hercules\! A great pleasure indeed comes over the one who, at that moment, considers: “I’ll make this one wealthier; I’ll heap some splendor onto his merit, by adding my riches to his.” If we don’t give except when we’ll get a return, then we’ll have to die intestate\!

\[4.12.4\] When you ask what return one gets from a gift or good deed, I will reply: “A good conscience.” What return comes from benefiting someone? Tell me, what return comes from justice, from innocence, from greatness of mind, from modesty, from self-restraint? If you seek something outside these virtues, you do not seek these virtues. For what end does the world change its seasons? For what does the sun lengthen the day, then shorten it? All these are benefits; they come about to do us good. Just as the cosmos has the duty of revolving the order of all matter, just as the sun has the duty to shift the places where it rises and sets, and to make these changes healthful for us, without any reward—just so, generosity is the duty of humanity. Why does one give? In order *not to fail to give*, not to lose the chance of doing good.

\[4.14\] If you give a benefit in order to reap a reward, you didn’t give it. You might as well claim that we give a benefit to animal stocks that we raise for our food or for labor\! Or that we benefit the fruit trees we tend, lest they suffer from drought or from the hardness of dry, compacted soil\! No one goes to cultivate a field out of a sense of justice or goodness, or does anything else in that spirit that produces an external gain. It’s beneficence that we’re called to, by thoughts neither greedy nor mean, but humane, generous, and willing to give even when we’ve already given, to increase prior gifts with new and fresh ones, having only this one objective, how much good we will do for the person to whom we give*.* It’s low and base, a thing without praise or renown, to do good because it’s expedient. What greatness is there in loving oneself, being soft on oneself, feathering one’s own nest? The true desire to give calls us away from all those, lays its hand on us and hauls us away toward loss, and gives up advantage for the very great joy of simply doing good.

\[4.17.2\] Just as there’s no law that bids us love our parents or gratify our children \(for there’s no point in being pushed in the direction we were already headed\), just as no one has to be encouraged toward love of self, which takes hold even at the moment of birth, just so there’s no law for this: seeking honorable things for their own sake. They give pleasure by their own nature, and virtue is so gratifying that even wicked people instinctively approve of better things. Is there anyone who would not wish to seem beneficent, who would not cherish a reputation for goodness even amid crimes and wrongs, who would not cloak in the semblance of rectitude his most lawless deeds and appear to have helped those he has harmed? Thus do people allow those whom they’ve destroyed to render thanks, and they fake being good and generous because they can’t give in reality. They wouldn’t do this unless love of honor, desirable for its own sake, compelled them to cultivate a reputation contrary to their natures, to hide their wickedness; they covet the gains they reap from it, but the quality itself incurs hatred and shame.

No one has fallen so far away from the law of nature, or detached from humanity, as to be evil from the heart. Pick anyone you want from among those who live by robbery, and ask whether he’d rather get by decent methods the things he pursues by theft and piracy. That man whose occupation is to lie in wait and attack passers-by will want to find things rather than steal them. You’ll meet no one who wouldn’t prefer to enjoy the rewards of wickedness if he could do so without being wicked. We have from nature this greatest award of all: Virtue casts its light into the souls of all people, and those who do not follow it, see it nonetheless.

\[4.18\] So that you may understand that gratitude is something to be sought for its own sake: *In*gratitude is a thing to be *shunned* for its own sake. No other flaw so much undoes and tears apart the harmony of the human race. What else gives us safety, other than helping each other by good service? Life is better equipped and more fortified against sudden attacks by this one thing: exchange of good deeds. Suppose we’re just isolated individuals; what are we? Prey for wild animals, victims, the sweetest meat and the easiest to come by. Other creatures have enough strength for their own protection; those born to be rovers, destined for a solitary life, have been armed with defenses, but only a frail layer of skin cloaks humankind. We possess no strength of claw or fang to frighten other creatures. Naked and weak, we have only fellowship25 for protection.

God has given two things to take humankind from subservience to enormous strength: Fellowship and Reason. Thus, the creature that could hold its own with no other, if separated from its kind, is in fact lord of creation. Fellowship has given us dominion over all the animals, and though we were born for life on land, it has switched us to control of an alien sphere, commanding us to be masters even of the sea. It has fended off onsets of diseases, provided supports in advance of old age, and given comforts against sorrows; it makes us brave; we can call upon it as an aid against Fortune. Take away Fellowship and you break the unity of the human race, by which our life is sustained.

Yet Fellowship *will* be removed, if you reject the idea that ingratitude must be shunned for its own sake, and instead make fear the motive. For how many are there who can be ingrates in safety\! In the end, I call ungrateful anyone who is grateful only through fear.

\[4.20\] “But,” you object, “there *is* some advantage gained from this virtue.” Yes, and of what virtue is that *not* true? Generosity is said to be sought for its own sake because it still gratifies us even if we take away, and distance ourselves from, whatever utility it has outside itself. It’s helpful to be grateful—yes, but I’ll do so even if it’s harmful. \[4.20.3\] It’s the ingrate who looks to *another* bequest at the moment he pays back the first, who anticipates while making return. I call them ingrates who sit beside a sick man because he’s making out a will, who take the time to ponder the man’s descendants and estate. Though they do all the things that good and dutiful friends are obliged to, if it’s hope of wealth that captivates their minds, they’re only fishermen dangling hooks. Just like birds that feed by tearing at the bodies of carrion, that watch for the members of the flock to grow sick and weak, picking out the next one to fall—so these people hang upon death and flitter about the corpse.

\[4.21\] The grateful heart is different; it’s held in thrall by the very virtue of its own designs. Do you want to know this for certain, to know that it is not corrupted by mere expedience? There are two kinds of grateful people. Some are called grateful because they give something back in exchange for what they received. These can make a display of generosity, perhaps; they have something to boast of, to exhibit. Others who are called grateful have received a gift with a good heart, and owe it in the same way, but keep their gratitude sealed up in their conscience. What advantage can they gain from this hidden emotion? Yet these too are grateful, even if able to do nothing more to show it. They love, they feel obligation, they *want* to return the favor. Even if you think something’s lacking beyond these things, they themselves lack for nothing.

\[4.21.3\] Let’s say I *want* to return a favor. I still have more to do beyond wanting, in order to be debt-free, whereas there’s nothing more needed to be grateful. Often the one who *does* repay a favor is an ingrate, and the one who *doesn’t* is the opposite. Just as with all the other virtues, so this one can only be reckoned up with reference to the heart. If the heart is dutiful, then Fortune is to blame for anything that’s lacking.

People are grateful even if they only *want* to be so, and have no other witness to that desire than themselves. No, I’ll push this even harder: Sometimes even those who seem to be *un*grateful are grateful, even if public opinion, with its wicked distortions, portrays them as their contraries. What else do they follow except their own consciences?

\[4.23\] Is there any doubt that the orbits of the sun and the phases of the moon temper this home of the human race? Or that the heat of the sun nourishes our bodies, loosens the soil, restrains excesses of moisture, and dispels the gloom of all-binding winter, while the warmth of the moon, as it penetrates and exerts its influence, governs the ripening of fruits? Or that human fertility responds to the moon’s progress? Or that the sun’s circuit allows us to define the year, while the moon marks out the month as it revolves in smaller circles? Take away those secondary effects, and wouldn’t the sun still be a sight to behold, worthy of our adoration, if it did nothing more than pass overhead? Wouldn’t the moon deserve our gaze if it only sped past like a careless constellation?

The very universe that pours out its fires throughout the night and shines with such a countless multitude of stars—whose gaze does it not hold spellbound? Yet who imagines that these things are for *their* benefit, as they stand in wonder? Look upon them as they glide past in the heavens in such a multitude. How they disguise their speed in the semblance of a still, unmoving mass\! How much is taking place during that night that you use for counting out the days of the calendar\! How great the throng of events unscrolled beneath their silence\! How vast a sequence of fates their unwavering course brings forth\! \[4.24\] What then? Won’t you be gripped by the spectacle of so great a structure, even if it didn’t cover you, care for you, nurture you, beget you, and wash over you with its exhalations?

Just as the stars have special use for us and are vital and needful, yet hold our minds in thrall with their magnificence, just so does virtue of every kind, and gratitude above all, have much to offer us; yet it does not seek to be cherished on that account. It holds yet more within itself; those who count it among *useful* things don’t understand it very well. Is a person grateful because it brings advantage? Will the gratitude be matched to the scale of the advantage?

\[4.25\] We make it our goal to live in accord with Nature and to follow the gods’ example. Yet what do the gods seek, in whatever they do, other than simply the idea of doing it? Unless perhaps you suppose that they sense some reward for their labors from the smoke of sacrifice and the scent of burning incense? See how they toil every day, and how great the dole they provide; how many fruits they fill the earth with, how opportunely they stir the seas with winds that bear us to every shore, how heavy the sudden downpours with which they soften the soil and refresh the dry roots of springs, renewing them by pouring nourishment into their hidden sources. They do all this without recompense, without any benefit to themselves. Let *our* way of life, too, keep to this principle \(if it does not swerve from its model\): not to seek honorable things for the sake of a salary. Let us feel shame if any gift or good deed has a price. The gods, after all, are ours for free.

*In the remaining three books of* On Benefits*, Seneca turns to specific problems in the ethics of giving; the discussion becomes more casuistic and less inspirational. It’s possible Seneca added these books at a later date than the composition of the first four. They are sampled less fully here.*

*The following passage strikes one of Seneca’s favorite themes \(also sounded in* On Anger*, an essay excerpted in an earlier volume for this series,* How to Keep Your Cool*\): the idea that failings of human nature are universal, and therefore our forgiveness for them should be universal as well. Then Seneca moves swiftly to another of his central themes \(explored in* How to Die*, also in this series\): the shadow cast by death on all human choices and values.*

\[5.15\] “If we follow your thinking,” someone objects, “no one is ungrateful, just as, on the other hand, *all* are ungrateful.” Indeed—for as I’ve said, all fools are wicked; whoever has one failing, has them all; all people are foolish, and therefore wicked; so, all are also ungrateful.

What do I mean, you ask? Aren’t they so? Doesn’t the indictment against the human race arise from all sides? Isn’t it a source of public outrage that gifts and good deeds are squandered, and that there are very few people who don’t return the worst sort of treatment to those who have treated them well? \[5.17.3\] We are a nation of ingrates. Let each do a personal inquiry: no one will fail to find an ingrate to complain of. And it’s not possible that everyone would file this complaint, unless everyone deserved to be complained of. So it follows that *all* are ungrateful.

But are they *only* ungrateful?26 No, they’re all greedy, and spiteful, and fearful \(especially those who seem bold\). Add this: they’re all ambitious and irreverent. But there’s no cause to get angry. Forgive them, for they’re all insane.

I don’t want to lead you into obscurities, so I say: “Look, how ungrateful youth is\! Who, though innocent, does not hope for his father’s last day; who, though self-restrained, does not await that day, or think about it, though dutiful? How much does each of us fear the death of a spouse, yet who does not also reckon up the odds that it will happen? What defendant acquitted of crime, I ask you, retains the memory of such a great boon beyond the very next hour?”

Here’s something that’s widely acknowledged: Who dies without a complaint? Who dares to say on his last day, “I’ve lived, and I’ve finished the course Fortune set me?” Who doesn’t leave this life protesting and groaning? Yet to be dissatisfied with the time that has passed is the mark of an ingrate. Your days will always be few if you count them. Don’t think of your highest good as length of time. However much you have, consider it a boon. Though your day of death be postponed, that won’t advance your good fortune; your life won’t be happier for the delay, just longer. How much better, in view of the pleasures you have reaped, not to count up the years of others but to make a kindly assessment of your own, and set them down as a profit\! “God judged me worthy of this much, and this much is enough. God might have done more, but this alone is a gift.” Let’s be grateful toward the gods, toward humankind, toward those who have done something for us or for those we hold dear.

*Throughout his essays, Seneca summons the words of imagined critics, then replies to them \(prompting some ancient scribes to classify these works as “dialogues”\). In the following segment, Seneca returns to a distinction he has already made, between gifts and loans, exploring it this time by conversing with a fictitious speaker who claims Seneca has blurred those two categories.*

\[5.20.6\] Someone will say: “Why do you spend so much effort asking to whom you should do a good turn, as though you were someday going to seek repayment?” Some people think that repayment should never be asked. They advance these reasons: “The unworthy will not repay even when asked; the worthy will repay of their own accord. Besides, if you give to a good person, beware lest you insult him by calling in the chit, as though he had not been about to repay voluntarily. If you give to a bad person, you’re the victim, but don’t ruin a gift by making it into a loan.”

\[5.20.7\] Words, words, words. So long as I’m not in any way pressed, so long as Fortune does not compel it, I’d rather count my good turn as a loss than ask for it back. But if there’s a question of my children’s health, if my wife is placed in any danger, if the safety and freedom of my homeland sends me to where I don’t want to go, I’ll master my shame and I’ll bear witness that I’ve done all I can to avoid needing the help of an ungrateful person, but at last the need to retrieve my good turn will conquer my embarrassment at asking for payback. As I’ve said, when I give to a good person, I do so as though never intending to ask for it back, unless it becomes necessary.

\[5.21.2\] “But you’re making a benefit into a loan\!” you say. Not at all. I don’t demand, but merely request—in fact, I don’t even request so much as remind. Will even the ultimate necessity drive me to approach someone with whom I would need to have a long quarrel? Surely not. If anyone’s so ungrateful that even a reminder is not enough, I’ll pass on by and regard as unworthy the person who must be forced to be grateful.

\[5.22\] There are many who are in the dark both about denying and repaying what they’ve received, who are not as good as the grateful nor as wicked as the ingrates, who are merely slow and late—overdue loans rather than bad debts. I won’t ask for payback from these, but I’ll remind them and lead them back to their duty from their other pursuits. They’ll reply right away: “Forgive me; by Hercules, I didn’t know that you needed it, or I would have brought it to you without prompting; I beg you not to think of me as ungrateful. I remember well what you did for me.” Why would I hesitate to make these people better than they were, both for my sake and their own? Whomever I can prevent from doing wrong, I shall prevent, especially a friend, both so that he doesn’t do wrong and, most of all, doesn’t wrong *me.* I give him another gift if I stop him from becoming an ingrate. What’s more, I won’t remonstrate harshly over what I did for him, but as gently as I am able.

\[5.23\] Some people should be woken up with just a nudge, not a blow, and in the same way, some people’s good-faith sense of gratitude is not dead, just asleep. Let’s wake it up.

*In book 6, Seneca returns to the idea \(already expressed in books 2 and 4\) that the gods are our models of generosity. This time, he gives the theme a stronger astronomical focus, since the planets and other heavenly bodies are, in his eyes, embodiments of the gods’ beneficence, if not gods themselves. He once again invokes an imaginary opponent to serve as his straw man—someone who doesn’t believe that the sun and moon deserve our gratitude. The argument against this person hinges on the question of whether these heavenly bodies are truly benevolent—that is, whether they have a desire to help humankind.*

\[6.19.5\] A deed must be done *on my account* in order to put me under obligation. “But if you think that way,” you say, “you owe nothing to the moon or the sun; for they’re not set in motion *on your account*.” But since they *are* set in motion in order to preserve the cosmos, they are also set in motion *for me*—I’m a part of that cosmos. Anyway, our condition and theirs is not the same. If someone helps me in order that through me he may help himself, he has not done a good deed, but only made me an implement of his own advantage. But the sun and moon can’t help themselves through helping us, even if they do help us \(for their own reasons\). For what help could we possibly give *them*?

\[6.21\] “I’d understand that the sun and moon *want* to help us,” you say, “if they were able to *not* want that. But they can’t cease to be in motion. Here’s my point: Let them stand still and take a break from their service.” \[6.21.4\] “Let them cease *wanting*,” you say. Here you run into the following: Who is so insane as to deny that a will exists when it runs no risk of ceasing or changing into the opposite—seeing that, to look at the contrary case, no one seems to *want* as much as the person whose will is so fixed as to be eternal? If someone *wants* who can, in an instant, cease to want, doesn’t the one to whom “not wanting” never occurs seem to truly *want*?

“Well alright, let them stop if they can,” you say. This is what you’re saying: Let all those objects, separated by huge distances and put in place for the care of the universe, desert their posts; let stars smash into stars in a sudden confusion of matter, and with the harmony of things torn asunder, let divinity collapse into ruin, let the whole tapestry, with its incomparable speed, call a halt in mid-motion to orbits that were promised for so many ages, and let all that now moves by turns to and fro with ideal balance, smoothing out the earth’s temperatures, be consumed by a sudden blaze; out of this great diversity, let everything dissolve and melt into one thing; let fire take hold of all, then torpid night possess it, and let the deep abyss drain down this great number of gods.

Is it worth the ruin of all this to show you that you’re wrong? These heavenly objects *do* help you, even if you don’t want them to, and they stay in motion for your sake, even if they started up for some other, greater sake.

\[6.23\] Consider this too, that nothing external compels the gods, but their will is everlasting and follows their own law. What they have established does not change. They can’t seem to be going to do something that they don’t want to do. Whatever they can’t stop, they *wanted* to continue moving; they never have regret for the plan they first contrived. Without doubt, they cannot stand still, or withdraw to the opposite side, but the only reason is that their own power holds them to their purpose; they remain steadfast, not through feebleness but because it does not please them to stray from perfection, and because it was established that they move thus. What’s more, in that first dispensation, when they set out the stuff of the cosmos, they had regard even for *our* lot, and took account of humanity. Thus, they can’t be seen to run through the skies and unfold their work solely for their own sake, since we too are a part of that work.

So we *do* owe a debt of good will toward the sun, the moon, and the other celestial bodies; even if they rise in the sky for reasons they deem more pressing, they still assist us as they advance to greater things. Then add this: They aid us according to a plan; we’re in their debt. We didn’t merely stumble on a gift bestowed by ignorant beings. They *knew* we would receive the things we’ve received; and though their purpose is grander than mere preservation of the mortal sphere, and the reward of their action is greater as well, yet their mind was extended toward our advantage since the beginning of all things, and the world has been so ordered as to reveal that the gods’ care for us was far from their least concern.

We owe reverence to our parents, though many of them did not intend our procreation. But we cannot imagine the gods didn’t know what they were going to achieve when they provided aid and a continuous food supply to all living things. We cannot imagine that they created by accident the creatures for whom they produced so much.

Nature imagined us before making us. We’re not such a trivial creation that we could have simply dropped out of her. Just look at how much scope we are given, and how human power extends far beyond the human realm. Look at how widely Nature allows our bodies to travel, not stopping them at the boundaries of lands but sending them into every part of herself. Look at the great daring of our minds, how these alone come either to know the gods or to seek them, and to join with divinities by way of thoughts raised on high. You’ll know then that humankind is not a rag-tag or unplanned creation. There’s nothing among Nature’s greatest objects she can boast of more, or certainly, no other she can boast *to*.

What madness then to dispute with the gods over whether we’ve been given a gift\! How can we ever show gratitude to those who can be thanked only by outlay of expense, if we deny that we’ve had the generosity of the beings who’ve been most generous to us, and who will both continue to give and will never get anything back?27

*How bad a flaw is ingratitude? The closing segment of* On Benefits *shows Seneca once again contemplating this question, this time in a more charitable frame of mind than in books 2, 3, and 4. He here relies on his notion of the universal sinfulness of humankind to argue that ingrates, like other sinners, deserve forgiveness and kind treatment. He illustrates this notion with a vivid analogy, comparing humanity to a rampaging army sacking a conquered city. In that chaos of greed and violence, who can be expected to act well?*

*The point Seneca wants to establish is that only by accepting ingratitude can we continue to be generous \(which is to say, virtuous\) beings. We must never allow our disappointment in those who receive to stop us from giving.*

\[7.26\] You ask the most essential question of all, one fitting for the closing section of this essay: How are we to treat the ungrateful? I say: With a tranquil, calm, and noble mind. However ungrateful, thoughtless, and inhuman the ones who offend you, don’t ever regret your decision to give. Never let outrage push you into statements like this: “I wish I hadn’t done it.” Rather, take pleasure in the bad outcome of your gift. *They* will always have regrets, provided that *you* feel no regret at this moment. You’ve no cause for indignation, as though something novel had happened; you ought rather to be amazed if it had *not* happened. The effort required deters some from gratitude; expense, others; danger, others; still others, a contemptible embarrassment, an unwillingness to admit, by giving back, that they have received; others, ignorance of duty; others, laziness; still others, a busy schedule.

Look here\! how the vast desires of humanity always grasp and demand; you won’t be surprised then if *no one* gives back, since no one gets enough. Who among us is of such sound and solid character that you can safely put your gifts in their hands? One rages with lust, another’s a slave to his belly; another’s all about money, looking only to his bottom line, not to the means of earning it; another struggles with envy, another with blind ambition that rushes headlong into armed combat. Now add slowness of mind, and old age, and at the other extreme, the restlessness and ceaseless tumults of an unquiet heart. Add a too-great sense of self-worth and swollen arrogance over things that deserve our disdain. Why mention stubborn striving for depravities, or shallow flitting from one thing to another? There’s more—headlong rashness, fear that never gives loyal counsel, a thousand wrongs in which we’re wrapped up; the boldness of the most timid, the discord of those most closely bound together, and, our national vice, trust in uncertainties, and contempt for possessions we once had no hope of acquiring. Among these most unstable of passions, do you really seek faithfulness, the most stable thing of all?

\[7.27\] If a true picture of human life should come into your thoughts, you’ll think you see the image of a city just captured. All regard for shame and right has been lost; violence is in charge, as though the signal had been given to throw everything into chaos. Fire and sword hold sway; crime is released from restraint of law; not even religion, normally a shield for suppliants even amid enemy weapons, restrains those rushing to seize booty. Plunderers assault the private and the public, the sacred and profane; they break down doors and leap over walls, or, not content with a narrow entrance, hurl down whatever blocks them and reach for riches over the ruins. One man despoils but does not kill; another carries off his booty with a bloody hand. There’s no one who doesn’t grab something from someone else.

You there\! Too forgetful of our common lot, amid this greed of the human race—if, that is, you’re looking amid the city-sackers for someone to give something back. If you feel outrage that there are ingrates, feel it also for the overindulgent, the greedy, the unchaste. . . . Ingratitude *is* a serious failing, beyond endurance; it dissolves human bonds, breaks up and destroys the harmony by which our frailty is protected. Yet it’s so common that even those who complain of it don’t escape it.

Take stock with yourself. Have *you* returned a favor to those you owed? Has no service ever been lost on you? Does the memory of all your benefits stay with you for all time? You’ll discover that things given in childhood slipped away before adolescence; those bestowed in youth did not survive into old age. Some we lose, others we toss out, some disappear little by little from our gaze, from others we turn away our eyes. \[7.28.2\] You might find in your own heart, if you search yourself thoroughly, the fault you complain of. You’re unjust if you’re angry at a general offense, foolish, if at your own; give pardon and you’ll be pardoned. You’ll make others better by bearing with them, worse, by your reproach. There’s no reason to furrow their brows; let them save face, however much face they have left. Often the too-loud voice of a carping critic shatters a shaky set of scruples. We don’t fear to be what we seem. It’s the one who’s been found out who loses the sense of shame.28

\[7.29\] “I wasted my gift,” you say. But do we ever call “lost” the things we have dedicated to the gods? A gift or good deed well bestowed is one of those things, even if it spurs a bad response. “He’s not the sort we thought he was”; but *we* should remain the sort we are, very different from *him*. Your loss only *came to light* at this moment; it happened long before. The ingrate brings shame on us when revealed, for we can’t make an issue of the lost gift without flagging the fact it was badly given. As much as we can, let’s plead his case in our own minds: “Perhaps he couldn’t, perhaps he didn’t realize, perhaps he’s still going to do it.” A patient and wise creditor sometimes collects on delinquent accounts by keeping them open and helping them by postponement. We must do likewise.29 Let’s nurture the sense of trust when it grows weary.

\[7.30\] “But I wasted my benefit.” Fool\! You don’t understand the time sequence of your loss; you lost it when you gave it, even if that’s only now becoming clear. Even when things seem to be lost, an attitude of restraint does the most good. Handicaps of the mind, like those of the body, have to be dealt with gently. Often what you might have untangled with perseverance gets snapped off by a rash pull.30 What need is there of curses, of complaints, of abuse? Why release those you’ve helped, and set them free? I answer: If they’re ungrateful, so what? They owe you nothing. What’s the point in estranging those for whom you’ve done great things, so that you’ll make a sometime friend into a full-time enemy? So that they’ll seek their own protection by way of our disrepute? So that this will be heard: “I can’t figure out why he couldn’t put up with the one he owed so much to; there’s something going on”? Everyone besmirches, not to say sullies, the dignity of a higher-up, and no one is content with merely trivial slanders, seeking to win belief by the magnitude of the lie.31

\[7.31\] How much better is the path of preserving an appearance of friendship, or, if we want to return to sound thinking, true friendship\! A commitment of good will overcomes the wicked. No one is of such harsh and hostile disposition, in the face of what ought to be cherished, as not to love good people even while wronging them—people to whom he owes this new debt, that he is not penalized for nonpayment. Turn your thoughts in this direction: “My favors were not returned. What should I do? What the gods do, the best sponsors of all things—they who start by giving to those who don’t know them, and continue giving to those who are ungrateful. Some hold them to blame for their neglect of us, others for unjust treatment; some situate them outside their own world and make them out slackers and sluggards, lacking light and having no function; some call the sun a kind of stone, or a chance accumulation of flames, or some other thing than a god—the sun, to which we owe the fact that we divide our time between work and rest, that we escape the chaos of eternal night \(not plunged into darkness\); the sun that moderates the seasons with its course through the sky, that nurtures our bodies, that brings forth crops and ripens fruit\!

“But just like the best kind of parents, who smile at their young children’s curses, the gods don’t stop laying on benefits, even for those in doubt about the source of those benefits. They spread their good things among the nations and peoples in an unbroken, even stream. With the one power they are allotted—doing good—they sprinkle the lands with timely rains, move seas with the wind, mark out the seasons with courses of stars, soften the strength of summer and winter with brief stretches of milder weather, and endure, calmly and benignly, the error of our inconstant souls. Let’s do as they do. Let’s give, even if much that we give ends up useless. Let’s give to others nonetheless; let’s give even to those who caused our losses. Collapse never stopped anyone from raising up houses, and, when fire has consumed everything, down to the shrines of the gods, we lay foundations on the still-smoldering ground and commit new cities to the same soil where others sank. That’s how stubbornly the heart clings to good hopes. Human efforts would have come to a halt on land and sea, had it not pleased us to try once again the things we attempted unsuccessfully at first.

“So they’re ungrateful; they didn’t hurt me, but themselves. As for me, I got the reward of my gift when I gave it. I won’t be slower to give as a result of this, but more selective. What I squandered on them, I’ll get back from others. But even to them I’ll give once again, and, like a good farmer, I’ll overcome the sterile soil with care and cultivation. My gift is lost to me, but *they* are lost to humanity. It’s not the sign of a great soul to give a gift and lose it, but rather to lose it—and then give.”

*With those words,* On Benefits *comes to a close. But Seneca again took up the topic of giving and receiving in one of his* Moral Epistles*, a set of open letters on various topics, composed near the end of his life. What follows is the last portion of* Epistle 81*, a letter that expands on many of the ideas discussed in* On Benefits *\(and indeed is characterized by Seneca as a sequel to that work\).*





DE BENEFICIIS





\[1.1\] Inter multos ac varios errores temere inconsulteque viventium nihil propemodum, vir optime Liberalis, dixerim, quam quod beneficia nec dare scimus nec accipere. Sequitur enim, ut male conlocata male debeantur; de quibus non redditis sero querimur; ista enim perierunt, cum darentur. Nec mirum est inter plurima maximaque vitia nullum esse frequentius quam ingrati animi. Id evenire ex causis pluribus video.

Prima illa est, quod non eligimus dignos, quibus tribuamus. Sed nomina facturi diligenter in patrimonium et vitam debitoris inquirimus, semina in solum effetum et sterile non spargimus: beneficia sine ullo dilectu magis proicimus quam damus.

Nec facile dixerim, utrum turpius sit infitiari an repetere beneficium; id enim genus huius crediti est, ex quo tantum recipiendum sit, quantum ultro refertur; decoquere vero foedissimum ob hoc ipsum, quia non opus est ad liberandam fidem facultatibus sed animo; reddit enim beneficium, qui debet.

Sed cum sit in ipsis crimen, qui ne confessione quidem grati sunt, in nobis quoque est. Multos experimur ingratos, plures facimus, quia alias graves exprobratores exactoresque sumus, alias leves et quos paulo post muneris sui paeniteat, alias queruli et minima momenta calumniantes; gratiam omnem corrumpimus non tantum postquam dedimus beneficia, sed dum damus.

Quis nostrum contentus fuit aut leviter rogari aut semel? Quis non, cum aliquid a se peti suspicatus est, frontem adduxit, vultum avertit, occupationes simulavit, longis sermonibus et de industria non invenientibus exitum occasionem petendi abstulit et variis artibus necessitates properantes elusit, in angusto vero conprensus aut distulit, id est timide negavit, aut promisit, sed difficulter, sed subductis superciliis, sed malignis et vix exeuntibus verbis? Nemo autem libenter debet, quod non accepit, sed expressit.

Gratus adversus eum esse quisquam potest, qui beneficium aut superbe abiecit aut iratus impegit aut fatigatus, ut molestia careret, dedit? Errat, si quis sperat responsurum sibi, quem dilatione lassavit, expectatione torsit. Eodem animo beneficium debetur, quo datur, et ideo non est neglegenter dandum. Sibi enim quisque debet, quod a nesciente accepit. Ne tarde quidem, quia, cum omni in officio magni aestimetur dantis voluntas, qui tarde fecit, diu noluit; utique non contumeliose. Nam cum ita natura comparatum sit, ut altius iniuriae quam merita descendant et illa cito defluant, has tenax memoria custodiat, quid expectat, qui offendit, dum obligat? Satis adversus illum gratus est, si quis beneficio eius ignoscit.

\[1.1.9\] Non est autem, quod tardiores faciat ad bene merendum turba ingratorum. Nam primum, ut dixi, nos illam augemus; deinde ne deos quidem immortales ab hac tam effusa nec cessante benignitate sacrilegi neglegentesque eorum deterrent. Utuntur natura sua et cuncta interque illa ipsos munerum suorum malos interpretes iuvant. Hos sequamur duces, quantum humana imbecillitas patitur; demus beneficia, non feneremus. Dignus est decipi, qui de recipiendo cogitavit, cum daret.

“At male cessit.” Et liberi et coniuges spem fefellerunt, tamen et educamus et ducimus, adeoque adversus experimenta pertinaces sumus, ut bella victi et naufragi maria repetamus. Quanto magis permanere in dandis beneficiis decet\!

Quae si quis non dat, quia non recepit, dedit, ut reciperet, bonamque ingratorum facit causam, quibus turpe est non reddere, si licet. Quam multi indigni luce sunt\! tamen dies oritur. Quam multi, quod nati sunt, queruntur\! tamen natura subolem novam gignit ipsosque, qui non fuisse mallent, esse patitur.

Hoc et magni animi et boni proprium est, non fructum beneficiorum sequi, sed ipsa et post malos quoque bonum quaerere. Quid magnifici erat multis prodesse, si nemo deciperet?

\[1.2.3\] Beneficiorum simplex ratio est: tantum erogatur; si redit aliquid, lucrum est, si non redit, damnum non est. Ego illud dedi, ut darem. Nemo beneficia in calendario scribit nec avarus exactor ad horam et diem appellat. Numquam illa vir bonus cogitat nisi admonitus a reddente; alioqui in formam crediti transeunt. Turpis feneratio est beneficium expensum ferre. Qualiscumque priorum eventus est, persevera in alios conferre. Melius apud ingratos iacebunt, quos aut pudor aut occasio aut imitatio aliquando gratos poterit efficere.

Ne cessaveris, opus tuum perage et partes boni viri exsequere. Alium re, alium fide, alium gratia, alium consilio, alium praeceptis salubribus adiuva. Officia etiam ferae sentiunt, nec ullum tam immansuetum animal est, quod non cura mitiget et in amorem sui vertat. Leonum ora a magistris impune tractantur, elephantorum feritatem usque in servile obsequium demeretur cibus; adeo etiam, quae extra intellectum atque aestimationem beneficii posita sunt, adsiduitas tamen meriti pertinacis evincit. Ingratus est adversus unum beneficium? Adversus alterum non erit. Duorum oblitus est? Tertium etiam in eorum, quae exciderunt, memoriam reducet.

Is perdet beneficia, qui cito se perdidisse credit; at qui instat et onerat priora sequentibus, etiam ex duro et immemori pectore gratiam extundit. Non audebit adversus multa oculos attollere; quocumque se convertit memoriam suam fugiens, ibi te videat. Beneficiis illum tuis cinge.

\[1.5\] Sed quemadmodum supervacua transcurram, ita exponam necesse est hoc primum nobis esse discendum, quid accepto beneficio debeamus. Debere enim se ait alius pecuniam, quam accepit, alius consulatum, alius sacerdotium, alius provinciam. Ista autem sunt meritorum signa, non merita. Non potest beneficium manu tangi; res animo geritur. Multum interest inter materiam beneficii et beneficium; itaque nec aurum nec argentum nec quicquam eorum, quae pro maximis accipiuntur, beneficium est, sed ipsa tribuentis voluntas. Imperiti autem id, quod oculis incurrit et quod traditur possideturque, solum notant, cum contra illud, quod in re carum atque pretiosum est, parvi pendunt. Haec, quae tenemus, quae aspicimus, in quibus cupiditas nostra haeret, caduca sunt, auferre nobis et fortuna et iniuria potest. Beneficium etiam amisso eo, per quod datum est, durat; est enim recte factum, quod irritum nulla vis efficit.

\[1.6\] Quid est ergo beneficium? Benevola actio tribuens gaudium capiensque tribuendo in id, quod facit, prona et sponte sua parata. Itaque non, quid fiat aut quid detur, refert, sed qua mente, quia beneficium non in eo, quod fit aut datur, consistit, sed in ipso dantis aut facientis animo. Magnum autem esse inter ista discrimen vel ex hoc intellegas licet, quod beneficium utique bonum est, id autem, quod fit aut datur, nec bonum nec malum est. Animus est, qui parva extollit, sordida illustrat, magna et in pretio habita dehonestat; ipsa, quae appetuntur, neutram naturam habent, nec boni nec mali; refert, quo illa rector impellat, a quo forma rebus datur. Non est beneficium ipsum, quod numeratur aut traditur, sicut ne in victimis quidem, licet opimae sint auroque praefulgeant, deorum est honor sed recta ac pia voluntate venerantium. Itaque boni etiam farre ac fitilla religiosi sunt; mali rursus non effugiunt impietatem, quamvis aras sanguine multo cruentaverint.

Si beneficia in rebus, non in ipsa bene faciendi voluntate consisterent, eo maiora essent, quo maiora sunt, quae accipimus. Id autem falsum est; non numquam enim magis nos obligat, qui dedit parva magnifice, qui “regum aequavit opes animo,” qui exiguum tribuit sed libenter, qui paupertatis suae oblitus est, dum meam respicit, qui non voluntatem tantum iuvandi habuit sed cupiditatem, qui accipere se putavit beneficium, cum daret, qui dedit tamquam numquam recepturus, recepit, tamquam non dedisset, qui occasionem, qua prodesset, et occupavit et quaesiit. Contra ingrata sunt, ut dixi, licet re ac specie magna videantur, quae danti aut extorquentur aut excidunt, multoque gratius venit, quod facili quam quod plena manu datur. Exiguum est, quod in me contulit, sed amplius non potuit; at hic quod dedit, magnum est, sed dubitavit, sed distulit, sed, cum daret, gemuit, sed superbe dedit, sed circumtulit et placere non ei, cui praestabat, voluit; ambitioni dedit, non mihi.

\[1.11\] Sequitur, ut dicamus, quae beneficia danda sint et quemadmodum. Primum demus necessaria, deinde utilia, deinde iucunda, utique mansura. Incipiendum est autem a necessariis; aliter enim ad animum pervenit, quod vitam continet, aliter, quod exornat aut instruit. Potest in eo aliquis fastidiosus esse aestimator, quo facile cariturus est, de quo dicere licet: “Recipe, non desidero; meo contentus sum.” Interim non reddere tantum libet, quod acceperis, sed abicere.

Ex his, quae necessaria sunt, quaedam primum optinent locum, sine quibus non possumus vivere, quaedam secundum, sine quibus non debemus, quaedam tertium, sine quibus nolumus. Prima huius notae sunt: hostium manibus eripi et tyrannicae irae et proscriptioni et aliis periculis, quae varia et incerta humanam vitam obsident. \[1.11.4\] Proxima ab his sunt, sine quibus possumus quidem vivere, sed ut mors potior sit, tamquam libertas et pudicitia et mens bona. Post haec habebimus coniunctione ac sanguine usuque et consuetudine longa cara, ut liberos, coniuges, penates, cetera, quae usque eo animus sibi applicuit, ut ab illis quam vita divelli gravius existimet.

Subsecuntur utilia, quorum varia et lata materia est; hic erit pecunia non superfluens sed ad sanum modum habendi parata; hic erit honor et processus ad altiora tendentium; nec enim utilius quicquam est quam sibi utilem fieri.

Iam cetera ex abundanti veniunt delicatos factura. In his sequemur, ut opportunitate grata sint, ut non vulgaria, quaeque aut pauci habuerint aut pauci intra hanc aetatem aut hoc modo, quae, etiam si natura pretiosa non sunt, tempore aut loco fiant.

Videamus, quid oblatum maxime voluptati futurum sit, quid frequenter occursurum habenti, ut totiens nobiscum quotiens cum illo sit. Utique cavebimus, ne munera supervacua mittamus, ut feminae aut seni arma venatoria, ut rustico libros, ut studiis ac litteris dedito retia. Aeque ex contrario circumspiciemus, ne, dum grata mittere volumus, suum cuique morbum exprobratura mittamus, sicut ebrioso vina et valetudinario medicamenta. Maledictum enim incipit esse, non munus, in quo vitium accipientis adgnoscitur.



\[2.1\] Sic demus, quomodo vellemus accipere. Ante omnia libenter, cito, sine ulla dubitatione.

Ingratum est beneficium, quod diu inter dantis manus haesit, quod quis aegre dimittere visus est et sic dare, tamquam sibi eriperet. Etiam si quid intervenit morae, evitemus omni modo, ne deliberasse videamur; proximus est a negante, qui dubitavit, nullamque iniit gratiam. Nam cum in beneficio iucundissima sit tribuentis voluntas, quia nolentem se tribuisse ipsa cunctatione testatus est, non dedit sed adversus ducentem male retinuit. Multi autem sunt, quos liberales facit frontis infirmitas.

Gratissima sunt beneficia parata, facilia, occurrentia, ubi nulla mora fuit nisi in accipientis verecundia. Optimum est antecedere desiderium cuiusque, proximum sequi. Illud melius, occupare ante quam rogemur, quia, cum homini probo ad rogandum os concurrat et suffundatur rubor, qui hoc tormentum remittit, multiplicat munus suum. \[2.2\] Molestum verbum est, onerosum, demisso vultu dicendum, rogo. Huius facienda est gratia amico et quemcumque amicum sis promerendo facturus; properet licet, sero beneficium dedit, qui roganti dedit.

\[2.4\] At plerique sunt, qui beneficia asperitate verborum et supercilio in odium adducunt eo sermone usi, ea superbia, ut impetrasse paeniteat. Aliae deinde post rem promissam secuntur morae; nihil autem est acerbius, quam ubi quoque, quod impetrasti, rogandum est. Repraesentanda sunt beneficia, quae a quibusdam accipere difficilius est quam impetrare. Hic rogandus est, ut admoneat, ille, ut consummet; sic unum munus per multorum manus teritur, ex quo gratiae minimum apud promittentem remanet, quia auctori detrahit, quisquis post illum rogandus est. Hoc itaque curae habebis, si grate aestimari, quae praestabis, voles, ut beneficia tua inlibata, ut integra ad eos, quibus promissa sunt, perveniant, sine ulla, quod aiunt, deductione.

\[2.5\] Nihil aeque amarum quam diu pendere; aequiore quidam animo ferunt praecidi spem suam quam trahi. Plerisque autem hoc vitium est ambitione prava differendi promissa, ne minor sit rogantium turba, quales regiae potentiae ministri sunt, quos delectat superbiae suae longum spectaculum, minusque se iudicant posse, nisi diu multumque singulis, quid possint, ostenderint. Nihil confestim, nihil semel faciunt; iniuriae illorum praecipites, lenta beneficia sunt. \[2.5.2\] Inde illae voces, quas ingenuus dolor exprimit: “Fac, si quid facis” et: “Nihil tanti est; malo mihi iam neges.” Ubi in taedium adductus animus incipit beneficium odisse, dum expectat, potest ob id gratus esse?

\[2.5.4\] Omnis benignitas properat, et proprium est libenter facientis cito facere; qui tarde et diem de die extrahens profuit, non ex animo fecit. Ita duas res maximas perdidit, et tempus et argumentum amicae voluntatis; tarde velle nolentis est.



\[2.6.2\] Quam dulce, quam pretiosum est, si gratias sibi agi non est passus, qui dedit, si dedisse, dum dat, oblitus est\! Nam corripere eum, cui cum maxime aliquid praestes, dementia est et inserere contumeliam meritis. Itaque non sunt exasperanda beneficia nec quicquam illis triste miscendum. Etiam si quid erit, de quo velis admonere, aliud tempus eligite. Fabius Verrucosus beneficium ab homine duro aspere datum panem lapidosum vocabat, quem esurienti accipere necessarium sit, esse acerbum.



\[2.10\] Interdum etiam ipse, qui iuvatur, fallendus est, ut habeat nec, a quo acceperit, sciat. Arcesilan aiunt amico pauperi et paupertatem suam dissimulanti, aegro autem et ne hoc quidem confitenti deesse sibi in sumptum ad necessarios usus, clam succurrendum iudicasse; pulvino eius ignorantis sacculum subiecit, ut homo inutiliter verecundus, quod desiderabat, inveniret potius quam acciperet. “Quid ergo? ille nesciet, a quo acceperit?” Primum nesciat, si hoc ipsum beneficii pars est; deinde multa alia faciam, multa tribuam, per quae intellegat et illius auctorem; denique ille nesciet accepisse se, ego sciam me dedisse.

“Parum est” inquis. Parum, si fenerare cogitas; sed si dare, quo genere accipienti maxime profuturum erit, dabis. Contentus eris te teste; alioqui non bene facere delectat sed videri bene fecisse. “Volo utique sciat.” Debitorem quaeris. “Volo utique sciat.” Quid? si illi utilius est nescire, si honestius, si gratius, non in aliam partem abibis? “Volo sciat.” Ita tu hominem non servabis in tenebris?

Non nego, quotiens patitur res, respiciendum gaudium ex accipientis voluntate; sin adiuvari illum et oportet et pudet, si, quod praestamus, offendit, nisi absconditur, beneficium in acta non mitto. Quidni? ego illi non sum indicaturus me dedisse, cum inter prima praecepta ac maxime necessaria sit, ne umquam exprobrem, immo ne admoneam quidem. Haec enim beneficii inter duos lex est: alter statim oblivisci debet dati, alter accepti numquam.

Lacerat animum et premit frequens meritorum commemoratio. Libet exclamare, quod ille triumvirali proscriptione servatus a quodam Caesaris amico exclamavit, cum superbiam eius ferre non posset: “Redde me Caesari\!” Quousque dices: “Ego te servavi, ego eripui morti”? istud, si meo arbitrio memini, vita est, si tuo, mors est; nihil tibi debeo, si me servasti, ut haberes, quem ostenderes. Quousque me circumducis? quousque oblivisci fortunae meae non sinis? semel in triumpho ductus essem. Non est dicendum, quid tribuerimus: qui admonet, repetit; non est instandum, non est memoria renovanda, nisi ut aliud dando prioris admoneas.

Ne aliis quidem narrare debemus; qui dedit beneficium, taceat, narret, qui accepit. Dicetur enim, quod illi ubique iactanti beneficium suum: “Non negabis” inquit “te recepisse”; et cum respondisset: “Quando?” “Saepe quidem” inquit “et multis locis, id est, quotiens et ubicumque narrasti.” Quid opus est eloqui, quid alienum occupare officium? Est, qui istud facere honestius possit, quo narrante et hoc laudabitur, quod ipse non narras. Ingratum me iudicas, si istud te tacente nemo sciturus est.

\[2.11.4\] Deinde adicienda omnis humanitas. Perdet agricola, quod sparsit, si labores suos destituit in semine; multa cura sata perducuntur ad segetem; nihil in fructum pervenit, quod non a primo usque ad extremum aequalis cultura prosequitur. Eadem beneficiorum condicio est. Numquid ulla maiora possunt esse, quam quae in liberos patres conferunt? haec tamen inrita sunt, si in infantia deserantur, nisi longa pietas munus suum nutrit. Eadem ceterorum beneficiorum condicio est: nisi illa adiuveris, perdes; parum est dedisse, fovenda sunt. Si gratos vis habere, quos obligas, non tantum des oportet beneficia, sed ames. Praecipue, ut dixi, parcamus auribus; admonitio taedium facit, exprobratio odium. Nihil aeque in beneficio dando vitandum est quam superbia. Quid opus arrogantia vultus, quid tumore verborum? Ipsa res te extollit. Detrahenda est inanis iactatio; res loquentur nobis tacentibus. Non tantum ingratum, sed invisum est beneficium superbe datum.

\[2.13\] O superbia, magnae fortunae stultissimum malum\! ut a te nihil accipere iuvat\! ut omne beneficium in iniuriam convertis\! ut te omnia dedecent\! quoque altius te sublevasti, hoc depressior es ostendisque tibi non datum adgnoscere ista bona, quibus tantum inflaris; quidquid das, corrumpis. Libet itaque interrogare, quid se tanto opere resupinet, quid vultum habitumque oris pervertat, ut malit personam habere quam faciem? Iucunda sunt, quae humana fronte, certe leni placidaque tribuuntur, quae cum daret mihi superior, non exultavit supra me, sed quam potuit benignissimus fuit descenditque in aequum et detraxit muneri suo pompam. \[2.13.3\] . . . Uno modo istis persuadebimus ne beneficia sua insolentia perdant, si ostenderimus . . . vanam esse superbiae magnitudinem et quae in odium etiam amanda perducat.

Sunt quaedam nocitura impetrantibus, quae non dare sed negare beneficium est. Aestimabimus itaque utilitatem potius quam voluntatem petentium. Saepe enim noxia concupiscimus, nec dispicere, quam perniciosa sint, licet, quia iudicium interpellat adfectus; sed cum subsedit cupiditas, cum impetus ille flagrantis animi, qui consilium fugat, cecidit, detestamur perniciosos malorum munerum auctores. Ut frigidam aegris negamus et lugentibus ac sibi iratis ferrum, ut amentibus, quidquid contra se usurus ardor petit, sic omnia, quae nocitura sunt, impense ac submisse, non numquam etiam miserabiliter rogantibus perseverabimus non dare. Cum initia beneficiorum suorum spectare tum etiam exitus decet et ea dare, quae non tantum accipere, sed etiam accepisse delectet.

Multi sunt, qui dicant: “Scio hoc illi non profuturum, sed quid faciam? Rogat, resistere precibus eius non possum. Viderit: de se, non de me queretur.” Falsum est: immo de te et merito quidem. Cum ad mentem bonam redierit, cum accessio illa, quae animum inflammabat, remiserit, quidni eum oderit, a quo in damnum ac periculum suum adiutus est? Exorari in perniciem rogantium saeva bonitas est. Quemadmodum pulcherrimum opus est etiam invitos nolentesque servare, ita rogantibus pestifera largiri blandum et adfabile odium est. Beneficium demus, quod in usu magis ac magis placeat, quod numquam in malum vertat. Pecuniam non dabo, quam numeraturum adulterae sciam, nec in societate turpis facti aut consilii inveniar. Si potero, revocabo, si minus, non adiuvabo, scelus.

\[2.15.3\] Respiciendae sunt cuique facultates suae viresque, ne aut plus praestemus, quam possumus, aut minus. Aestimanda est eius persona, cui damus. Quaedam enim minora sunt, quam ut exire a magnis viris debeant, quaedam accipiente maiora sunt. Utriusque itaque personam confer et ipsum inter illas, quod donabis, examina, numquid aut danti grave sit aut parum, numquid rursus, qui accepturus est, aut fastidiat aut non capiat.

Urbem cuidam Alexander donabat, vesanus et qui nihil animo nisi grande conciperet. Cum ille, cui donabatur, se ipse mensus tanti muneris invidiam refugisset dicens non convenire fortunae suae: “Non quaero” inquit, “quid te accipere deceat, sed quid me dare.” Animosa vox videtur et regia, cum sit stultissima. Nihil enim per se quemquam decet; refert, qui det, cui, quando, quare, ubi, et cetera, sine quibus facti ratio non constabit. Tumidissimum animal\! \[2.16.2\] Liceat istud sane tibi et te in tantum fortuna sustulerit, ut congiaria tua urbes sint \(quas quanto maioris animi fuit non capere quam spargere\!\). Est tamen aliquis minor, quam ut in sinu eius condenda sit civitas.

Ab Antigono Cynicus petit talentum; respondit plus esse, quam quod Cynicus petere deberet. Repulsus petit denarium; respondit minus esse, quam quod regem deceret dare. “Turpissima eiusmodi cavillatio est. Invenit, quomodo neutrum daret. In denario regem, in talento Cynicum respexit, cum posset et denarium tamquam Cynico dare et talentum tamquam rex. Ut sit aliquid maius, quam quod Cynicus accipiat, nihil tam exiguum est, quod non honeste regis humanitas tribuat.” Si me interrogas, probo. Est enim intolerabilis res poscere nummos et contemnere. Indixisti pecuniae odium; hoc professus es, hanc personam induisti; agenda est. Iniquissimum est te pecuniam sub gloria egestatis adquirere. Adspicienda ergo non minus sua cuique persona est quam eius, de quo iuvando quis cogitat.

\[2.17.3\] Volo Chrysippi nostri uti similitudine de pilae lusu, quam cadere non est dubium aut mittentis vitio aut excipientis; tum cursum suum servat, ubi inter manus utriusque apte ab utroque et iactata et excepta versatur. Necesse est autem lusor bonus aliter illam conlusori longo, aliter brevi mittat. Eadem beneficii ratio est: nisi utrique personae, dantis et accipientis, aptatur, nec ab hoc exibit nec ad illum perveniet, ut debet. Si cum exercitato et docto negotium est, audacius pilam mittemus; utcumque enim venerit, manus illam expedita et agilis repercutiet. Si cum tirone et indocto, non tam rigide nec tam excusse sed languidius et in ipsam eius derigentes manum remisse occurremus. Idem faciendum est in beneficiis: quosdam doceamus et satis iudicemus, si conantur, si audent, si volunt. Facimus autem plerumque ingratos et, ut sint, favemus, tamquam ita demum magna sint beneficia nostra, si gratia illis referri non potuit.

\[2.17.6\] Multi sunt tam pravae naturae, ut malint perdere, quae praestiterunt, quam videri recepisse, superbi et imputatores. Quanto melius quantoque humanius id agere, ut illis quoque partes suae constent, et favere, ut gratia sibi referri possit, benigne omnia interpretari, gratias agentem non aliter, quam si referat, audire, praebere se facilem ad hoc, ut, quem obligavit, etiam exolvi velit\! Male audire solet fenerator, si acerbe exigit, aeque, si in recipiendo tardus ac difficilis moras quaerit. Beneficium tam recipiendum est quam non exigendum. Optimus ille, qui facile dedit, numquam exegit, reddi gavisus est, bona fide, quid praestitisset, oblitus, qui accipientis animo recepit.



\[2.18.1\] Iam enim transeamus ad alteram partem tractaturi, quomodo se gerere homines in accipiendis beneficiis debeant.

\[2.18.2\] \[Ratio\] autem hoc primum censebit: non ab omnibus accipiendum. A quibus ergo accipiemus? Ut breviter tibi respondeam: ab his, quibus dedissemus. Videamus, num etiam maiore dilectu quaerendus sit, cui debeamus, quam cui praestemus. Nam ut non sequantur ulla incommoda \(secuntur autem plurima\), grave tamen tormentum est debere, cui nolis; contra iucundissimum ab eo accepisse beneficium, quem amare etiam post iniuriam possis. \[2.18.5\] Itaque eligendum est, a quo beneficium accipiam; et quidem diligentius quaerendus beneficii quam pecuniae creditor. Huic enim reddendum est, quantum accepi, et, si reddidi, solutus sum ac liber; at illi et plus solvendum est, et nihilo minus etiam relata gratia cohaeremus.

\[2.22\] Cum accipiendum iudicaverimus, hilares accipiamus profitentes gaudium, et id danti manifestum sit, ut fructum praesentem capiat. Iusta enim causa laetitiae est laetum amicum videre, iustior fecisse. \[2.23\] Sunt quidam, qui nolint nisi secreto accipere; testem beneficii et conscium vitant, quos scias licet male cogitare. . . . Quod pudet debere, ne acceperis. Quidam furtive gratias agunt et in angulo et ad aurem. Non est ista verecundia, sed infitiandi genus; ingratus est, qui remotis arbitris agit gratias.

\[2.24.2\] Nec delicate accipiendum est nec submisse et humiliter. Nam qui neglegens est in accipiendo, cum omne beneficium recens pateat, quid faciat, cum prima eius voluptas refrixit? Alius accipit fastidiose, tamquam qui dicat: “Non quidem mihi opus est, sed quia tam valde vis, faciam tibi mei potestatem”; alius supine, ut dubium praestanti relinquat, an senserit; alius vix labra diduxit et ingratior, quam si tacuisset, fuit.

Loquendum est pro magnitudine rei impensius et illa adicienda: “Plures, quam putas, obligasti” \(nemo enim non gaudet beneficium suum latius patere\); “nescis, quid mihi praestiteris, sed scire te oportet, quanto plus sit, quam existimas” \(statim gratus est, qui se onerat\); “numquam tibi referre gratiam potero, illud certe non desinam ubique confiteri me referre non posse.” \[2.25.2\] His atque eiusmodi vocibus id agamus, ut voluntas nostra non lateat, sed aperiatur et luceat. Verba cessent licet; si, quemadmodum debemus, adfecti sumus, conscientia eminebit in vultu.

\[2.26\] Videndum est nunc, quid maxime faciat ingratos. Facit aut nimius sui suspectus et insitum mortalitati vitium se suaque mirandi aut aviditas aut invidia. Incipiamus a primo.

Nemo non benignus est sui iudex; inde est, ut omnia meruisse se existimet et in solutum accipiat nec satis suo pretio se aestimatum putet. “Hoc mihi dedit, sed quam sero, sed post quot labores\! Quanto consequi plura potuissem, si illum aut illum aut me colere maluissem\! Non hoc speraveram: in turbam coniectus sum. Tam exiguo dignum me iudicavit? Honestius praeteriri fuit.”

\[2.27.3\] Non patitur aviditas quemquam esse gratum; numquam enim improbae spei, quod datur, satis est, et maiora cupimus, quo maiora venerunt, multoque concitatior est avaritia in magnarum opum congestu collocata, ut flammae infinito acrior vis est, quo ex maiore incendio emicuit.

Aeque ambitio non patitur quemquam in ea mensura honorum conquiescere, quae quondam eius fuit impudens votum. Nemo agit de tribunatu gratias, sed queritur, quod non est ad praeturam usque perductus; nec haec grata est, si deest consulatus; ne hic quidem satiat, si unus est. Ultra se cupiditas porrigit et felicitatem suam non intellegit, quia non, unde venerit, respicit, sed quo tendat.

\[2.28\] Omnibus his vehementius et importunius malum est invidia, quae nos inquietat, dum comparat: “Hoc mihi praestitit, sed illi plus, sed illi maturius”; et deinde nullius causam agit, contra omnes sibi favet. Quanto est simplicius, quanto prudentius beneficium acceptum augere, scire neminem tanti ab alio, quanti a se ipso aestimari\! “Plus accipere debui, sed illi facile non fuit plus dare; in multos dividenda liberalitas erat; hoc initium est, boni consulamus et animum eius grate excipiendo evocemus; parum fecit, sed saepius faciet; illum mihi praetulit, et me multis; ille non est mihi par virtutibus nec officiis, sed habuit suam Venerem; querendo non efficiam, ut maioribus dignus sim, sed ut datis indignus. Plura illis hominibus turpissimis data sunt; quid ad rem? Quam raro fortuna iudicat\! Cottidie querimur malos esse felices; saepe, quae agellos pessimi cuiusque transierat, optimorum virorum segetem grando percussit; fert sortem suam quisque ut in ceteris rebus ita in amicitiis.” Nullum est tam plenum beneficium, quod non vellicare malignitas possit, nullum tam angustum, quod non bonus interpres extendat. Numquam deerunt causae querendi, si beneficia a deteriore parte spectaveris.

Vide, quam iniqui sint divinorum munerum aestimatores et quidem professi sapientiam. Queruntur, quod non magnitudine corporum aequemus elephantos, velocitate cervos, levitate aves, impetu tauros, quod solida sit cutis beluis, decentior dammis, densior ursis, mollior fibris, quod sagacitate nos narium canes vincant, quod acie luminum aquilae, spatio aetatis corvi, multa animalia nandi facilitate. Et cum quaedam ne coire quidem in idem natura patiatur, ut velocitatem corporum et vires, ex diversis ac dissidentibus bonis hominem non esse compositum iniuriam vocant et neglegentes nostri deos, quod non bona valetudo etiam vitiis inexpugnabilis data sit, quod non futuri scientia. Vix sibi temperant, quin eo usque impudentiae provehantur, ut naturam oderint, quod infra deos sumus, quod non in aequo illis stetimus. Quanto satius est ad contemplationem tot tantorumque beneficiorum reverti et agere gratias, quod nos in hoc pulcherrimo domicilio voluerunt secundas sortiri, quod terrenis praefecerunt\! Aliquis ea animalia comparat nobis, quorum potestas penes nos est? Quidquid nobis negatum est, dari non potuit.

Proinde, quisquis es iniquus aestimator sortis humanae, cogita, quanta nobis tribuerit parens noster, quanto valentiora animalia sub iugum miserimus, quanto velociora consequamur, quam nihil sit mortale non sub ictu nostro positum. Tot virtutes accepimus, tot artes, animum denique, cui nihil non eodem, quo intendit, momento pervium est, sideribus velociorem, quorum post multa saecula futuros cursus antecedit; tantum deinde frugum, tantum opum, tantum rerum aliarum super alias acervatarum. Circumeas licet cuncta et, quia nihil totum invenies, quod esse te malles, ex omnibus singula excerpas, quae tibi dari velles. Bene aestimata naturae indulgentia confitearis necesse est in deliciis te illi fuisse.

Ita est: carissimos nos habuerunt di immortales habentque, et, qui maximus tribui honos potuit, ab ipsis proximos collocaverunt. Magna accepimus, maiora non cepimus.

Haec, mi Liberalis, necessaria credidi, et quia loquendum aliquid de maximis beneficiis erat, cum de minutis loqueremur, et quia inde manat etiam in cetera huius detestabilis vitii audacia. Cui enim respondebit grate, quod munus existimabit aut magnum aut reddendum, qui summa beneficia spernit? Cui salutem, cui spiritum debebit, qui vitam accepisse se a dis negat, quam cottidie ab illis petit?

Quicumque ergo gratos esse docet, et hominum causam agit et deorum, quibus nullius rei indigentibus, positis extra desiderium, referre nihilo minus gratiam possumus. Non est, quod quisquam excusationem mentis ingratae ab infirmitate atque inopia petat et dicat: “Quid enim faciam et quomodo? Quando superioribus dominisque rerum omnium gratiam referam?” Referre facile est: si avarus es, sine impendio, si iners, sine opera. Eodem quidem momento, quo obligatus es, si vis, cum quolibet paria fecisti, quoniam, qui libenter beneficium accipit, reddidit.

\[2.33\] Beneficium mihi dedit, accepi non aliter, quam ipse accipi voluit. Iam habet, quod petit, et quod unum petit, ergo gratus sum. Post hoc usus mei restat et aliquod ex homine grato commodum; hoc non imperfecti officii reliqua pars est, sed perfecti accessio. Facit Phidias statuam, alius est fructus artis, alius artificii. Artis est fecisse, quod voluit, artificii fecisse cum fructu. Perfecit opus suum Phidias, etiam si non vendidit.

\[2.34\] “Quid ergo?” inquit “rettulit gratiam, qui nihil fecit?” Primum fecit: bono animo bonum obtulit et, quod est amicitiae, ex aequo. Post deinde aliter beneficium, aliter creditum solvitur. Non est, quod expectes, ut solutionem tibi ostendam. Res inter animos geritur.

\[2.35.3\] “Bona mihi donata sunt et fama defensa, detractae sordes, spiritus servatus et libertas spiritu potior. Et quomodo referre gratiam potero? Quando ille veniet dies, quo illi animum meum ostendam?” Hic ipse est, quo ille suum ostendit. Excipe beneficium, amplexare, gaude, non quod accipias, sed quod reddas debiturusque sis. Non adibis tam magnae rei periculum, ut casus ingratum facere te possit.

Nullas tibi proponam difficultates, ne despondeas animum, ne laborum ac longae servitutis expectatione deficias; non differo te, de praesentibus fiat. Numquam eris gratus, nisi statim es.

Quid ergo facies? Non arma sumenda sunt, at fortasse erunt. Non maria emetienda, fortasse etiam ventis minantibus solves. Vis reddere beneficium? Benigne accipe. Rettulisti gratiam, non ut solvisse te putes, sed ut securior debeas.



\[3.1.3\] Multa sunt genera ingratorum, ut furum, ut homicidarum, quorum una culpa est, ceterum in partibus varietas magna. Ingratus est, qui beneficium accepisse se negat, quod accepit; ingratus est, qui dissimulat, ingratus, qui non reddit, ingratissimus omnium, qui oblitus est. Illi enim si non solvunt, tamen debent, et extat apud illos vestigium certe meritorum intra malam conscientiam inclusorum; aliquando ad referendam gratiam converti ex aliqua causa possunt, si illos pudor admonuerit, si subita honestae rei cupiditas, qualis solet ad tempus etiam in malis pectoribus exurgere, si invitaverit facilis occasio. Hic numquam fieri gratus potest, cui beneficium totum elapsum est.

Et utrum tu peiorem vocas, apud quem gratia beneficii intercidit, an apud quem etiam memoria? Vitiosi oculi sunt, qui lucem reformidant, caeci, qui non vident. Et parentes suos non amare impietas est, non adgnoscere insania. \[3.2.2\] Denique ad reddendam gratiam et virtute opus est et tempore et facultate et adspirante fortuna. Qui meminit, sine impendio gratus est. Hoc, quod non operam exigit, non opes, non felicitatem, qui non praestat, nullum habet, quo lateat, patrocinium.

\[3.3\] Praeter hanc causam aliae quoque sunt, quae nobis merita non numquam maxima evellant. Prima omnium ac potentissima, quod novis semper cupiditatibus occupati, non quid habeamus, sed quid petamus, spectamus. In id, quod adpetitur, intentis, quidquid est domi, vile est. Sequitur autem, ut, ubi quod acceperis leve novorum cupiditas fecit, auctor quoque eorum non sit in pretio. Amavimus aliquem et suspeximus et fundatum ab illo statum nostrum professi sumus, quamdiu nobis placebant ea, quae consecuti sumus. Deinde irrumpit animum aliorum admiratio, et ad ea impetus factus est, uti mortalibus mos est ex magnis maiora cupiendi. Protinus excidit, quidquid ante apud nos beneficium vocabatur, nec ea intuemur, quae nos aliis praeposuere, sed ea sola, quae fortuna praecedentium ostentat.

Non potest autem quisquam et invidere et gratias agere, quia invidere querentis et maesti est, gratias agere gaudentis. Deinde quia nemo nostrum novit nisi id tempus, quod cum maxime transit, ad praeterita rari animum retorquent. Sic fit, ut praeceptores eorumque beneficia intercidant, quia totam pueritiam reliquimus; sic fit, ut in adulescentiam nostram collata pereant, quia ipsa numquam retractatur. Nemo, quod fuit, tamquam in praeterito sed tamquam in perdito ponit, ideoque caduca memoria est futuro imminentium.

\[3.17\] “Quid ergo? impunitus erit ingratus?” Quid ergo, impunitus erit impius? Quid malignus? Quid avarus? Quid impotens? Quid crudelis? Impunita tu credis esse, quae invisa sunt, aut ullum supplicium gravius existimas publico odio? Poena est, quod non audet ab ullo beneficium accipere, quod non audet ulli dare, quod omnium designatur oculis aut designari se iudicat, quod intellectum rei optimae ac dulcissimae amisit. An tu infelicem vocas, qui caruit acie, cuius aures morbus obstruxit, non vocas miserum eum, qui sensum beneficiorum amisit? Testes ingratorum omnium deos metuit, urit illum et angit intercepti beneficii conscientia. Denique satis haec ipsa poena magna est, quod rei, ut dicebam, iucundissimae fructum non percipit.



\[4.1\] Ex omnibus, quae tractavimus, Aebuti Liberalis, potest videri nihil tam necessarium aut magis, ut ait Sallustius, cum cura dicendum, quam quod in manibus est: an beneficium dare et in vicem gratiam referre per se res expetendae sint.

Inveniuntur, qui honesta in mercedem colant quibusque non placeat virtus gratuita; quae nihil habet in se magnificum, si quicquam venale. Quid enim est turpius, quam aliquem computare, quanti vir bonus sit, cum virtus nec lucro invitet nec absterreat damno. . . ? Calcatis ad illam utilitatibus eundum est; quocumque vocavit, quocumque misit, sine respectu rei familiaris, interdum etiam sine ulla sanguinis sui parsimonia vadendum nec umquam imperium eius detractandum. “Quid consequar,” inquit, “si hoc fortiter, si hoc grate fecero?” Quod feceris; nihil tibi extra promittitur.

\[4.3.2\] Non est beneficium, quod ad fortunam spectat. Praeterea, si, ut prodessemus, sola nos invitaret utilitas, minime beneficia distribuere deberent, qui facillime possent, locupletes et potentes et reges aliena ope non indigentes. Di vero tot munera, quae sine intermissione diebus ac noctibus fundunt, non darent; in omnia enim illis natura sua sufficit plenosque et tutos et inviolabiles praestat. Nulli ergo beneficium dabunt, si una dandi causa est se intueri ac suum commodum. Istud non beneficium, sed fenus est circumspicere, non ubi optime ponas, sed ubi quaestuosissime habeas, unde facillime tollas.

\[4.4.3\] Quis est autem tam miser, tam neglectus, quis tam duro fato et in poenam genitus, ut non tantam deorum munificentiam senserit? Ipsos illos complorantes sortem suam et querulos circumspice. Invenies non ex toto beneficiorum caelestium expertes, neminem esse, ad quem non aliquid ex illo benignissimo fonte manaverit. Parum est autem id, quod nascentibus ex aequo distribuitur? Ut quae secuntur inaequali dispensata mensura transeamus, parum dedit natura, cum se dedit?

\[4.5\] “Non dat deus beneficia.” Unde ergo ista, quae possides, quae das, quae negas, quae servas, quae rapis? Unde haec innumerabilia oculos, aures, animum mulcentia? Unde illa luxuriam quoque instruens copia, neque enim necessitatibus tantummodo nostris provisum est, usque in delicias amamur? Tot arbusta non uno modo frugifera, tot herbae salutares, tot varietates ciborum per totum annum digestae, ut inerti quoque fortuita terrae alimenta praeberent? Iam animalia omnis generis, alia in sicco solidoque, alia in umido nascentia, alia per sublime demissa, ut omnis rerum naturae pars tributum aliquod nobis conferret? Flumina haec amoenissimis flexibus campos cingentia, illa praebitura commercio viam vasto et navigabili cursu vadentia, ex quibus quaedam aestatis diebus mirabile incrementum trahunt, ut arida et ferventi subiecta caelo loca subita vis aestivi torrentis irriget? Quid mercatorum torrentium venae? Quid in ipsis litoribus aquarum calentium exundatio?

\[4.6\] Si pauca quis tibi donasset iugera, accepisse te diceres beneficium. Immensa terrarum late patentium spatia negas esse beneficium? Si pecuniam tibi aliquis donaverit et arcam tuam, quoniam tibi id magnum videtur, impleverit, beneficium vocabis; tot metalla deus defodit, tot flumina emisit terra, super quae decurrunt sola, aurum vehentia; argenti, aeris, ferri immane pondus omnibus locis obrutum, cuius investigandi tibi facultatem dedit, ac latentium divitiarum in summa terra signa disposuit; negas te accepisse beneficium? Si domus tibi donetur, in qua marmoris aliquid resplendeat et tectum nitidius auro aut coloribus sparsum, non mediocre munus vocabis. Ingens tibi domicilium sine ullo incendii aut ruinae metu struxit, in quo vides non tenues crustas et ipsa, qua secantur, lamna graciliores, sed integras lapidis pretiosissimi moles, sed totas variae distinctaeque materiae, cuius tu parvula frusta miraris, tectum vero aliter nocte, aliter interdiu fulgens, negas te ullum munus accepisse? Et cum ista, quae habes, magno aestimes, quod est ingrati hominis, nulli debere te iudicas? Unde tibi istum, quem trahis, spiritum? Unde istam, per quam actus vitae tuae disponis atque ordinas, lucem? Unde sanguinem, cuius cursu vitalis continetur calor? Unde ista palatum tuum saporibus exquisitis ultra satietatem lacessentia? Unde haec irritamenta iam lassae voluptatis? Unde ista quies, in qua putrescis ac marces? Nonne, si gratus es, dices: deus nobis haec otia fecit?

Ille deus est, non qui paucas boves, sed qui per totum orbem armenta dimisit, qui gregibus ubique passim vagantibus pabulum praestat, qui pascua hibernis aestiva substituit, qui non calamo tantum cantare et agreste atque inconditum carmen ad aliquam tamen observationem modulari docuit, sed tot artes, tot vocum varietates, tot sonos alios spiritu nostro, alios externo cantus edituros commentus est. Neque enim nostra ista, quae invenimus, dixeris, non magis, quam quod crescimus.

\[4.7\] “Natura,” inquit, “haec mihi praestat.” Non intellegis te, cum hoc dicis, mutare nomen deo? Quid enim aliud est natura quam deus et divina ratio toti mundo partibusque eius inserta? Quotiens voles, tibi licet aliter hunc auctorem rerum nostrarum compellare; et Iovem illum Optimum ac Maximum rite dices et Tonantem et Statorem. . . . Hunc eundem et Fatum si dixeris, non mentieris. Nam cum fatum nihil aliud sit, quam series implexa causarum, ille est prima omnium causa, ex qua ceterae pendent. Quaecumque voles, illi nomina proprie aptabis vim aliquam effectumque caelestium rerum continentia. Tot appellationes eius possunt esse, quot munera.

\[4.9\] Plurima beneficia ac maxima in nos deus defert sine spe recipiendi, quoniam nec ille conlato eget nec nos ei quidquam conferre possumus. Ergo beneficium per se expetenda res est. Una spectatur in eo accipientis utilitas. Ad hanc accedamus sepositis commodis nostris.

“Dicitis,” inquit, “diligenter eligendos, quibus beneficia demus. . . . Praeterea quaeritis, ubi et quomodo detis beneficium, quod non esset faciendum, si per se beneficium dare expetenda res esset, quoniam, quocumque loco et quocumque modo daretur, beneficium erat.” Honestum propter nullam aliam causam quam propter ipsum sequimur; tamen, etiam si nihil aliud sequendum est, quaerimus, quid faciamus et quando et quemadmodum. Per haec enim constat. Itaque, cum eligo, cui dem beneficium, id ago, ut quandoque beneficium sit, quia, si turpi datur, nec honestum esse potest nec beneficium.

Depositum reddere per se res expetenda est; non tamen semper reddam nec quolibet loco nec quolibet tempore. Aliquando nihil interest, utrum infitier an palam reddam. Intuebor utilitatem eius, cui redditurus sum, et nociturum illi depositum negabo. Idem in beneficio faciam. Videbo, quando dem, cui dem, quemadmodum, quare. Nihil enim sine ratione faciendum est. Non est autem beneficium, nisi quod ratione datur, quoniam ratio omnis honesti comes est.

Quam saepe hominum donationem suam inconsultam obiurgantium vane exaudimus vocem: “Mallem perdidisse quam illi dedisse\!” Turpissimum genus damni est inconsulta donatio multoque gravius male dedisse beneficium quam non recepisse. Aliena enim culpa est, quod non recipimus; quod, cui daremus, non elegimus, nostra. In electione nihil minus quam hoc, quod tu existimas, spectabo, a quo recepturus sim. Elige enim eum, qui gratus, non qui redditurus sit. Saepe autem et non redditurus gratus est et ingratus, qui reddidit. Ad animum tendit aestimatio mea. Ideo locupletem sed indignum praeteribo, pauperi viro bono dabo. Erit enim in summa inopia gratus et, cum omnia illi deerunt, supererit animus.

Non lucrum ex beneficio capto, non voluptatem, non gloriam. Uni placere contentus in hoc dabo, ut quod oportet faciam. Quod oportet autem non est sine electione. Quae qualis futura sit, interrogas? Eligam virum integrum, simplicem, memorem, gratum, alieni abstinentem, sui non avare tenacem, benevolum. Hunc ego cum elegero, licet nihil illi fortuna tribuat, ex quo referre gratiam possit, ex sententia gesta res erit.

Si utilitas me et sordida computatio liberalem facit, si nulli prosum, nisi ut in vicem ille mihi prosit, non dabo beneficium proficiscenti in diversas longinquasque regiones, afuturo semper; non dabo sic adfecto, ut spes ei nulla sit convalescendi; non dabo ipse deficiens, non enim habeo recipiendi tempus. Atqui ut scias rem per se expetendam esse bene facere, advenis modo in nostrum delatis portum, statim abituris, succurrimus; ignoto naufrago navem, qua revehatur, et damus et struimus. Discedit ille vix satis noto salutis auctore et numquam amplius in conspectum nostrum reversurus debitores nobis deos delegat precaturque, illi pro se gratiam referant. Interim nos iuvat sterilis beneficii conscientia.

Quid? Cum in ipso vitae fine constitimus, cum testamentum ordinamus, non beneficia nihil nobis profutura dividimus? Quantum temporis consumitur, quam diu secreto agitur, quantum et quibus demus\! Quid enim interest, quibus demus a nullo recepturi? Atqui numquam diligentius damus, numquam magis iudicia nostra torquemus, quam ubi remotis utilitatibus solum ante oculos honestum stetit, tam diu officiorum mali iudices, quam diu illa depravat spes ac metus et inertissimum vitium, voluptas. Ubi mors interclusit omnia et ad ferendam sententiam incorruptum iudicem misit, quaerimus dignissimos, quibus nostra tradamus, nec quicquam cura sanctiore componimus, quam quod ad nos non pertinet. At mehercules tunc magna voluptas subit cogitantem: “Hunc ego locupletiorem faciam, et huius dignitati adiectis opibus aliquid splendoris adfundam.” Si non damus beneficia nisi recepturi, intestatis moriendum sit\!

\[4.12.4\] Cum interrogaveris, quid reddat, respondebo: bonam conscientiam. Quid reddat beneficium? Dic tu mihi, quid reddat iustitia, quid innocentia, quid magnitudo animi, quid pudicitia, quid temperantia? Si quicquam praeter ipsas, ipsas non petis. In quid mundus vices suas solvit? In quid sol diem extendit et contrahit? Omnia ista beneficia sunt, fiunt enim nobis profutura. Quomodo mundi officium est circumagere rerum ordinem, quomodo solis loca mutare, ex quibus oriatur, in quae cadat, et haec salutaria nobis facere sine praemio, ita viri officium est inter alia et beneficium dare. Quare ergo dat? Ne non det, ne occasionem bene faciendi perdat.

\[4.14\] Eodem modo, qui beneficium ut reciperet dedit, non dedit. Ergo et nos beneficium damus animalibus, quae aut usui aut alimento futura nutrimus\! Beneficium damus arbustis, quae colimus, ne siccitate aut immoti et neclecti soli duritia laborent\! Nemo ad agrum colendum ex aequo et bono venit nec ad ullam rem, cuius extra ipsam fructus est. Ad beneficium dandum non adducit cogitatio avara nec sordida, sed humana, liberalis, cupiens dare, etiam eum dederit, et augere novis ac recentibus vetera, unum habens propositum, quanto ei, cui praestat, bono futura sit. Alioqui humile est, sine laude, sine gloria, prodesse, quia expedit. Quid magnifici est se amare, sibi parcere, sibi adquirere? Ab omnibus istis vera beneficii dandi cupido avocat, ad detrimentum iniecta manu trahit et utilitates relinquit ipso bene faciendi opere laetissima.

\[4.17.2\] Quomodo nulla lex amare parentes, indulgere liberis iubet \(supervacuum est enim, in quod imus, impelli\), quemadmodum nemo in amorem sui cohortandus est, quem adeo, dum nascitur, trahit, ita ne ad hoc quidem, ut honesta per se petat. Placent suapte natura, adeoque gratiosa virtus est, ut insitum sit etiam malis probare meliora. Quis est, qui non beneficus videri velit, qui non inter scelera et iniurias opinionem bonitatis adfectet, qui non ipsis, quae impotentissime fecit, speciem aliquam induat recti velitque etiam his videri beneficium dedisse, quos laesit? Gratias itaque agi sibi ab iis, quos adflixere, patiuntur bonosque se ac liberales fingunt, quia praestare non possunt. Quod non facerent, nisi illos honesti et per se expetendi amor cogeret moribus suis opinionem contrariam quaerere et nequitiam abdere, cuius fructus concupiscitur, ipsa vero odio pudorique est.

Nec quisquam tantum a naturae lege descivit et hominem exuit, ut animi causa malus sit. Dic enim cuilibet ex istis, qui rapto vivunt, an ad illa, quae latrociniis et furtis consecuntur, malint ratione bona pervenire. Optabit ille, cui grassari et transeuntes percutere quaestus est, potius illa invenire quam eripere. Neminem reperies, qui non nequitiae praemiis sine nequitia frui malit. Maximum hoc habemus naturae meritum, quod virtus lumen suum in omnium animos permittit; etiam, qui non secuntur illam, vident.

\[4.18\] Ut scias per se expetendam esse grati animi adfectionem: per se fugienda res est ingratum esse, quoniam nihil aeque concordiam humani generis dissociat ac distrahit quam hoc vitium. Nam quo alio tuti sumus, quam quod mutuis iuvamur officiis? Hoc uno instructior vita contraque incursiones subitas munitior est, beneficiorum commercio. Fac nos singulos, quid sumus? Praeda animalium et victimae ac bellissimus et facillimus sanguis. Quoniam ceteris animalibus in tutelam sui satis virium est, quaecumque vaga nascebantur et actura vitam segregem, armata sunt, hominem imbecilla cutis cingit; non unguium vis, non dentium terribilem ceteris fecit, nudum et infirmum societas munit.

Duas deus res dedit, quae illum obnoxium validissimum facerent, rationem et societatem. Itaque, qui par esse nulli posset, si seduceretur, rerum potitur. Societas illi dominium omnium animalium dedit; societas terris genitum in alienae naturae transmisit imperium et dominari etiam in mari iussit; hoc morborum impetus arcuit, senectuti adminicula prospexit, solacia contra dolores dedit; hoc fortes nos facit, quod licet contra fortunam advocare. Hanc societatem tolle, et unitatem generis humani, qua vita sustinetur, scindes. Tolletur autem, si efficis, ut ingratus animus non per se vitandus sit, sed quia aliquid illi timendum est. Quam multi enim sunt, quibus ingratis esse tuto licet\! Denique ingratum voco, quisquis metu gratus est.

\[4.20\] “Sed inest,” inquit, “huic bono etiam utilitas aliqua.” Cui enim virtuti non inest? Sed id propter se expeti dicitur, quod, quamvis habeat aliqua extra commoda, sepositis quoque illis ac remotis placet. Prodest gratum esse. Ero tamen gratus, etiam si nocet. \[4.20.3\] Ingratus est, qui in referenda gratia secundum datum videt, qui sperat, cum reddit. Ingratum voco, qui aegro adsidit, quia testamentum facturus est, cui de hereditate aut de legato vacat cogitare. Faciat licet omnia, quae facere bonus amicus et memor officii debet, si animo eius obversatur spes lucri, captator est et hamum iacit. Ut aves, quae laceratione corporum aluntur, lassa morbo pecora et casura ex proximo speculantur, ita hic imminet morti et circa cadaver volat.

\[4.21\] Gratus animus ipsa virtute propositi sui capitur. Vis scire hoc ita esse nec illum utilitate corrumpi? Duo genera sunt grati hominis. Dicitur gratus, qui aliquid pro eo, quod acceperat, reddidit; hic fortasse ostentare se potest, habet, quod iactet, quod proferat. Dicitur gratus, qui bono animo accepit beneficium, bono debet; hic intra conscientiam elusus est. Quae illi contingere potest utilitas ex adfectu latenti? Atqui hic, etiam si ultra facere nil potest, gratus est. Amat, debet, referre gratiam cupit. Quidquid ultra desideras, non ipse deest.

\[4.21.3\] Volo referre gratiam. Post hoc aliquid superest mihi, non ut gratus, sed ut solutus sim. Saepe enim et qui gratiam rettulit, ingratus est, et qui non rettulit, gratus. Nam ut omnium aliarum virtutum, ita huius ad animum tota aestimatio redit. Hic si in officio est, quidquid defuit, fortuna peccat.

Ita gratus est etiam, qui vult tantum nec habet huius voluntatis suae ullum alium quam se testem. Immo amplius adiciam: est aliquando gratus etiam qui ingratus videtur, quem mala interpres opinio contrarium tradidit. Hic quid aliud sequitur quam ipsam conscientiam?

\[4.23\] Num dubium est, quin hoc humani generis domicilium circumitus solis ac lunae vicibus suis temperet? Quin alterius calore alantur corpora, terrae relaxentur, immodici umores comprimantur, adligantis omnia hiemis tristitia frangatur, alterius tepore efficaci et penetrabili regatur maturitas frugum? Quin ad huius cursum fecunditas humana respondeat? Quin ille annum observabilem fecerit circumactu suo, haec mensem minoribus se spatiis flectens? Ut tamen detrahas ista, non erat ipse sol idoneum oculis spectaculum dignusque adorari, si tantum praeteriret? Non erat digna suspectu luna, etiam si otiosum sidus transcurreret?

Ipse mundus, quotiens per noctem ignes suos fudit et tantum stellarum innumerabilium refulsit, quem non intentum in se tenet? Quis sibi illa tunc, cum miratur, prodesse cogitat? Adspice ista tanto superne coetu labentia, quemadmodum velocitatem suam sub specie stantis atque immoti operis abscondant. Quantum ista nocte, quam tu in numerum ac discrimen dierum observas, agitur\! Quanta rerum turba sub hoc silentio evolvitur\! Quantam fatorum seriem certus limes educit? \[4.24\] Quid ergo? Non caperis tantae molis adspectu, etiam si te non tegat, non custodiat, non foveat generetque ac spiritu suo riget?

Quemadmodum haec cum primum usum habeant et necessaria vitaliaque sint, maiestas tamen eorum totam mentem occupat, ita omnis illa virtus et in primis grati animi multum quidem praestat, sed non vult ob hoc diligi. Amplius quiddam in se habet, nec satis ab eo intellegitur a quo inter utilia numeratur. . . . Gratus est, quia expedit? Ergo et quantum expedit?

\[4.25\] Propositum est nobis secundum rerum naturam vivere et deorum exemplum sequi. Di autem, quodcumque faciunt, in eo quid praeter ipsam faciendi rationem secuntur? Nisi forte illos existimas fructum operum suorum ex fumo extorum et turis odore percipere? Vide, quanta cotidie moliantur, quanta distribuant; quantis terras fructibus impleant, quam opportunis et in omnes oras ferentibus ventis maria permoveant, quantis imbribus repente deiectis solum molliant venasque fontium arentes redintegrent et infuso per occulta nutrimento novent. Omnia ista sine mercede, sine ullo ad ipsos perveniente commodo faciunt. Hoc nostra quoque ratio, si ab exemplari suo non aberrat, servet, ne ad res honestas conducta veniat. Pudeat ullum venale esse beneficium, gratuitos habemus deos.



\[5.15\] “Quomodo,” inquit, “nemo per vos ingratus est, sic rursus omnes ingrati sunt.” Nam, ut dicimus, omnes stulti mali sunt. Qui unum autem habet vitium, omnia habet. Omnes autem stulti et mali sunt; omnes ergo ingrati sunt.

Quid ergo? Non sunt? Non undique humano generi convicium fit? Non publica querella est perisse beneficia et paucissimos esse, qui de bene merentibus non invicem pessime mereantur? \[5.17.3\] Ingrati publice sumus. Se quisque interroget: nemo non aliquem queritur ingratum. Atqui non potest fieri, ut omnes querantur, nisi querendum est de omnibus. Omnes ergo ingrati sunt.

Ingrati sunt tantum? Et cupidi omnes et maligni omnes et timidi omnes, illi in primis, qui videntur audaces. Adice: et ambitiosi omnes sunt et impii omnes. Sed non est, quod irascaris. Ignosce illis, omnes insaniunt.

Nolo te ad incerta revocare, ut dicam: “Vide, quam ingrata sit iuventus\! Quis non patris sui supremum diem, ut innocens sit, optat? Ut moderatus sit, expectat? Ut pius, cogitat? Quotus quisque uxoris optimae mortem timet, ut non et computet? Cui, rogo, litigatori defenso tam magni beneficii ultra res proximas memoria duravit?”

Illud in confesso est: Quis sine querella moritur? Quis extremo die dicere audet: “Vixi et quem dederat cursum fortuna peregi?” Quis non recusans, quis non gemens exit? Atqui hoc ingrati est non esse contentum praeterito tempore. Semper pauci dies erunt, si illos numeraveris. Cogita non esse summum bonum in tempore. Quantumcumque est, boni consules. Ut prorogetur tibi dies mortis, nihil proficitur ad felicitatem, quoniam mora non fit beatior vita sed longior. Quanto satius est gratum adversus perceptas voluptates non aliorum annos computare, sed suos benigne aestimare et in lucro ponere\! “Hoc me dignum iudicavit deus, hoc satis est. Potuit plus, sed hoc quoque beneficium est.” Grati simus adversus deos, grati adversus homines, grati adversus eos, qui aliquid nobis praestiterunt, grati etiam adversus eos, qui nostris praestiterunt.



\[5.20.6\] Dicet aliquis: “Quid tanto opere quaeris, cui dederis beneficium, tamquam repetiturus aliquando? Sunt, qui numquam iudicent esse repetendum, et has causas adferunt: Indignus etiam repetenti non reddet, dignus ipse per se referet. Praeterea, si bono viro dedisti, expecta, ne iniuriam illi facias appellando, tamquam sua sponte redditurus non fuisset. Si malo viro dedisti, plectere; beneficium vero ne corruperis creditum faciendo.”

\[5.20.7\] Verba sunt ista. Quam diu me nihil urguet, quam diu fortuna nihil cogit, perdam potius beneficium quam repetam. Sed si de salute liberorum agitur, si in periculum uxor deducitur, si patriae salus ac libertas mittit me etiam, quo ire nollem, imperabo pudori meo et testabor omnia me fecisse, ne opus esset mihi auxilio hominis ingrati; novissime recipiendi beneficii necessitas repetendi verecundiam vincet. Deinde, cum bono viro beneficium do, sic do tamquam numquam repetiturus, nisi fuerit necesse.

\[5.21.2\] “Sed ex beneficio,” inquit, “creditum facis.” Minime. Non enim exigo, sed repeto, et ne repeto quidem, sed admoneo. Num ultima quoque me necessitas in hoc aget, ut ad eum veniam, cum quo mihi diu luctandum sit? Si quis tam ingratus est, ut illi non sit satis admoneri, eum transibo nec dignum iudicabo, qui gratus esse cogatur.

\[5.22\] Multi sunt, qui nec negare sciant, quod acceperunt, nec referre, qui nec tam boni sunt quam grati nec tam mali quam ingrati, segnes et tardi, lenta nomina, non mala. Hos ego non appellabo, sed commonefaciam et ad officium aliud agentes reducam. Qui statim mihi sic respondebunt: “Ignosce; non mehercules scivi hoc te desiderare, alioqui ultro obtulissem; rogo, ne me ingratum existimes. Memini, quid mihi praestiteris.” Hos ego quare dubitem et sibi meliores et mihi facere? Quemcumque potuero, peccare prohibebo, multo magis amicum, et ne peccet et ne in me potissimum peccet. Alterum illi beneficium do, si illum ingratum esse non patior. Nec dure illi exprobrabo, quod praestiti, sed quam potuero mollissime.

\[5.23\] Quidam, ut expergiscantur, non feriendi, sed commovendi sunt. Eodem modo quorundam ad referendam gratiam fides non cessat, sed languet. Hanc pervellamus.



\[6.19.5\] Propter me debet factum esse, quod me obliget. “Isto,” inquit, “modo nec lunae nec soli quicquam debes; non enim propter te moventur.” Sed cum in hoc moveantur, ut universa conservent, et pro me moventur; universorum enim pars sum. Adice nunc, quod nostra et horum condicio dissimilis est. Nam qui mihi prodest, ut per me prosit sibi, non dedit beneficium, quia me instrumentum utilitatis suae fecit. Sol autem et luna, etiam si nobis prosunt sua causa, non in hoc tamen prosunt, ut per nos prosint sibi. Quid enim nos conferre illis possumus?

\[6.21\] “Sciam,” inquit, “solem ac lunam nobis velle prodesse, si nolle potuerint. Illis autem non licet non moveri. Ad summam consistant et opus suum intermittant.” \[6.21.4\] “Desinant,” inquit, “ velle.” Hoc loco tibi illud occurrat: Quis tam demens est, ut eam neget voluntatem esse, cui non est periculum desinendi vertendique se in contrarium, cum ex diverso nemo aeque videri debeat velle, quam cuius voluntas usque eo certa est, ut aeterna sit? An, si is quoque vult, qui potest statim nolle, is non videbitur velle, in cuius naturam non cadit nolle?

“Agedum,” inquit, “si possunt, resistant.” Hoc dicis: Omnia ista ingentibus intervallis diducta et in custodiam universi disposita stationes suas deserant; subita confusione rerum sidera sideribus incurrant, et rupta rerum concordia in ruinam divina labantur, contextusque velocitatis citatissimae in tot saecula promissas vices in medio itinere destituat; et, quae nunc alternis eunt redeuntque opportunis libramentis mundum ex aequo temperantia, repentino concrementur incendio; et ex tanta varietate solvantur atque eant in unum omnia; ignis cuncta possideat, quem deinde pigra nox occupet, et profunda vorago tot deos sorbeat.

Est tanti, ut tu coarguaris, ista concidere? Prosunt tibi etiam invito euntque ista tua causa, etiam si maior illis alia ac prior causa est.

\[6.23\] Adice nunc, quod non externa cogunt deos, sed sua illis in lege aeterna voluntas est. Statuerunt, quae non mutarent. Itaque non possunt videri facturi aliquid, quamvis nolint, quia, quidquid desinere non possunt, perseverare voluerunt; nec umquam primi consilii deos paenitet. Sine dubio stare illis et desciscere in contrarium non licet, sed non ob aliud, quam quia vis sua illos in proposito tenet; nec imbecillitate permanent, sed quia non libet ab optimis aberrare et sic ire decretum est. In prima autem illa constitutione, cum universa disponerent, etiam nostra viderunt rationemque hominis habuerunt. Itaque non possunt videri sua tantum causa decurrere et explicare opus suum, quia pars operis et nos sumus.

Debemus ergo et soli et lunae et ceteris caelestibus beneficium, quia, etiam si potiora illis sunt, in quae oriuntur, nos tamen in maiora ituri iuvant. Adice, quod ex destinato iuvant, ideoque obligati sumus, quia non in beneficium ignorantium incidimus. Sed haec, quae accipimus, accepturos scierunt; et quamquam maius illis propositum sit maiorque actus sui fructus, quam servare mortalia, tamen in nostras quoque utilitates a principio rerum praemissa mens est et is ordo mundo datus, ut appareat curam nostri non inter ultima habitam.

Debemus parentibus nostris pietatem, et multi non, ut gignerent, coierant. Di non possunt videri nescisse, quid effecturi essent, cum omnibus alimenta protinus et auxilia providerint, nec eos per neclegentiam genuere, quibus tam multa generabant.

Cogitavit nos ante natura, quam fecit, nec tam leve opus sumus, ut illi potuerimus excidere. Vide, quantum nobis permiserit, quam non intra homines humani imperii condicio sit. Vide, in quantum corporibus vagari liceat, quae non coercuit fine terrarum, sed in omnem partem sui misit. Vide, animi quantum audeant, quemadmodum soli aut noverint deos aut quaerant et mente in altum elata divina comitentur. Scies non esse hominem tumultuarium et incogitatum opus. Inter maxima rerum suarum natura nihil habet, quo magis glorietur, aut certe, cui glorietur.

Quantus iste furor est controversiam dis muneris sui facere\! Quomodo adversus eos hic erit gratus, quibus gratia referri sine impendio non potest, qui negat se ab iis accepisse, a quibus cum maxime accepit, qui et semper daturi sunt et numquam recepturi?



\[7.26\] Quaeris rem maxime necessariam et in qua hanc materiam consummati decet, quemadmodum ingrati ferendi sint. Placido animo, mansueto, magno. Numquam te tam inhumanus et immemor et ingratus offendat, ut non tamen dedisse delectet. Numquam in has voces iniuria impellat: “Vellem, non fecissem.” Beneficii tui tibi etiam infelicitas placeat. Semper illum paenitebit, si te ne nunc quidem paenitet. Non est, quod indigneris, tamquam aliquid novi acciderit; magis mirari deberes, si non accidisset. Alium labor, alium impensa deterret, alium periculum, alium turpis verecundia, ne, dum reddit, fateatur accepisse, alium ignorantia officii, alium pigritia, alium occupatio.

Adspice, quemadmodum immensae hominum cupiditates hient semper et poscant; non miraberis ibi neminem reddere, ubi nemo satis accepit. Quis est istorum tam firmae mentis ac solidae, ut tuto apud eum beneficia deponas? Alius libidine insanit, alius abdomini servit; alius lucri totus est, cuius summam, non vias, spectat; alius invidia laborat, alius caeca ambitione et in gladios irruente. Adice torporem mentis ac senium et contraria huic inquieti pectoris agitationem tumultusque perpetuos. Adice aestimationem sui nimiam et tumorem, ob quae contemnendus est, insolentem. Quid contumaciam dicam in perversa nitentium, quid levitatem semper aliquo transilientem? Hoc accedat temeritas praeceps et numquam fidele consilium daturus timor et mille errores, quibus volvimur; audacia timidissimorum, discordia familiarissimorum et, publicum malum, incertissimis fidere, fastidire possessa, quae consequi posse spes non fuit. Inter adfectus inquietissimos rem quietissimam, fidem, quaeris?

\[7.27\] Si tibi vitae nostrae vera imago succurret, videre videberis tibi captae cum maxime civitatis faciem, in qua omisso pudoris rectique respectu vires in concilio sunt velut signo ad permiscenda omnia dato. Non igni, non ferro abstinetur; soluta legibus scelera sunt; ne religio quidem, quae inter arma hostilia supplices texit, ullum impedimentum est ruentium in praedam. Hic ex privato, hic ex publico, hic ex profano, hic ex sacro rapit. Hic effringit, hic transilit; hic non contentus angusto itinere ipsa, quibus arcetur, evertit et in lucrum ruina venit. Hic sine caede populatur, hic spolia cruenta manu gestat. Nemo non fert aliquid ex altero.

In hac aviditate generis humani o ne tu nimis fortunae communis oblitus es, qui quaeris inter rapientes referentem\! Si indignans ingratos esse, indignare luxuriosos, indignare avaros, indignare impudicos. . . . Est istuc grave vitium, est intolerabile et quod dissociet homines, quod concordiam, qua imbecillitas nostra fulcitur, scindat ac dissipet, sed usque eo vulgare est, ut illud ne qui queritur quidem effugerit.

Cogita tecum, an, quibuscumque debuisti, gratiam rettuleris, an nullum umquam apud te perierit officium, an omnium te beneficiorum memoria comitetur. Videbis, quae puero data sunt, ante adulescentiam elapsa, quae in iuvenem conlata sunt, non perdurasse in senectutem. Quaedam perdidimus, quaedam proiecimus, quaedam e conspectu nostro paulatim exierunt, a quibusdam oculos avertimus. \[7.28.2\] Fortasse vitium, de quo querens, si te diligenter excusseris, in sinu invenies. Inique publico crimini irasceris, stulte tuo; ut absolvaris, ignosce. Meliorem illum facies ferendo, utique peiorem exprobrando. Non est, quod frontem eius indures. Sine, si quid est pudoris residui, servet. Saepe dubiam verecundiam vox conviciantis clarior rupit. Nemo id esse, quod iam videtur, timet. Deprenso pudor demitur.

\[7.29\] “Perdidi beneficium.” Numquid, quae consecravimus, perdidisse nos dicimus? Inter consecrata beneficium est, etiam si male respondit, bene conlatum. Non est ille, qualem speravimus; simus nos, quales fuimus, ei dissimiles. Damnum non tunc factum apparuit. Ingratus non sine nostro pudore protrahitur, quoniam quidem querella amissi beneficii non bene dati signum est. Quantum possumus, causam eius apud nos agamus: “Fortasse non potuit, fortasse ignoravit, fortasse facturus est.” Quaedam nomina bona lentus et sapiens creditor fecit, qui sustinuit ac mora fovit. Idem nobis faciundum est; nutriamus fidem languidam.

\[7.30\] “Perdidi beneficium.” Stulte non nosti detrimenti tui tempora\! Perdidisti, sed cum dares, nunc palam factum est. Etiam in his, quae videntur in perdito, moderatio plurimum profuit; ut corporum ita animorum molliter vitia tractanda sunt. Saepe, quod explicari pertinacia potuit, violentia trahentis abruptum est. Quid opus est maledictis? Quid querellis? Quid insectatione? Quare illum liberas? Quare dimittis? Si ingratus est, iam nihil debet. Quae ratio est exacerbare eum, in quem magna contuleris, ut ex amico dubio fiat non dubius inimicus et patrocinium sibi nostra infamia quaerat, nec desit vox: “Nescio quid est, quod eum, cui tantum debuit, ferre non potuit; subest aliquid”? Nemo non superioris dignitatem querendo, etiam si non inquinavit, adspersit, nec quisquam fingere contentus est levia, cum magnitudine mendacii fidem quaerat.

\[7.31\] Quanto illa melior via, qua servatur illi species amicitiae et, si reverti ad sanitatem velit, etiam amicitia\! Vincit malos pertinax bonitas, nec quisquam tam duri infestique adversus diligenda animi est, ut etiam in iniuria bonos non amet, quibus hoc quoque coepit debere, quod impune non solvit. Ad illa itaque cogitationes tuas flecte: “Non est relata mihi gratia, quid faciam? Quod di, omnium rerum optimi auctores, qui beneficia ignoranti dare incipiunt, ingratis perseverant. Alius illis obicit neclegentiam nostri, alius iniquitatem; alius illos extra mundum suum proicit et ignavos hebetesque sine luce, sine ullo opere destituit; alius solem, cui debemus, quod inter laborem quietemque tempus divisimus, quod non tenebris mersi confusionem aeternae noctis effugimus, qui annum cursu suo temperat et corpora alit, sata evocat, percoquit fructus, saxum aliquod aut fortuitorum ignium globum et quidvis potius quam deum appellat.

“Nihilo minus tamen more optimorum parentium, qui maledictis suorum infantium arrident, non cessant di beneficia congerere de beneficiorum auctore dubitantibus, sed aequali tenore bona sua per gentes populosque distribuunt; unam potentiam, prodesse, sortiti spargunt opportunis imbribus terras, maria flatu movent, siderum cursu notant tempora, hiemes aestatesque interventu lenioris spiritus molliunt, errorem labentium animarum placidi ac propitii ferunt. Imitemur illos. Demus, etiam si multa in irritum data sunt; demus nihilo minus aliis, demus ipsis, apud quos facta iactura est. Neminem ad excitandas domos ruina deterruit, et, cum penates ignis absumpsit, fundamenta tepente adhuc area ponimus et urbes haustas saepius eidem solo credimus. Adeo ad bonas spes pertinax animus est. Terra marique humana opera cessarent, nisi male temptata retemptare libuisset.

“Ingratus est. Non mihi fecit iniuriam, sed sibi. Ego beneficio meo, cum darem, usus sum. Nec ideo pignus dabo, sed diligentius; quod in hoc perdidi, ab aliis recipiam. Sed huic ipsi beneficium dabo iterum et tamquam bonus agricola cura cultuque sterilitatem soli vincam. Perit mihi beneficium, iste hominibus. Non est magni animi beneficium dare et perdere; hoc est magni animi perdere et dare.”





EPISTLE 81





\[19\] We should do all we can to be extremely grateful. For this virtue is entirely in our power, in a way justice is not \(though it’s generally assumed to be so\), for justice depends on others, while the great part of gratitude returns upon itself. Everyone helps themselves when they help another—not, I say, because the one helped will want to help *them*, or the one defended will protect them, or because a good model of behavior comes back around to those who set it \(in the way that bad models rebound back upon those who set them, and those who suffer wrongs they themselves have proven possible—by doing them—receive no sympathy\), but because the reward of all virtues is *in the virtues themselves*. They are not practiced according to a price chart. The payment for having done a virtuous deed is that you have done it.

I’m grateful, not in order that someone else, stirred by my example, will more willingly give to *me*, but in order to do a very gratifying and beautiful thing. I’m grateful not because it’s useful but because it’s pleasing. Understand that this is so by the following: If it’s not possible to be grateful except by appearing *un*grateful, if I can’t repay a benefit except by the appearance of doing harm, I will, with the most composed mind, steer toward an honorable goal even though I cross through the midst of ill-repute. No one, it seems to me, more highly prizes virtue, no one seems more committed to it than the one who loses the reputation of being a good person in order not to lose a good conscience. So it is that, as I said, you’re grateful more for the sake of your own good than that of another. That other person encounters something common and banal: getting back what he had given. Whereas *you* encounter a great thing, proceeding from the most blessed condition of the heart: gratitude. For if moral evil makes people unhappy, and virtue makes them happy, and to be grateful is a virtue, then you’ve made return of an ordinary thing but obtained an invaluable one: the consciousness of gratitude, which enters only into the divine and blessed mind.

The depths of unhappiness attend the opposite impulse, ingratitude. No one is grateful to himself if he has not been grateful to another. Do you think I mean this: that the ingrate will later be wretched? No, I don’t grant a postponement: he’s wretched *right now*.

Therefore, let’s avoid ingratitude, not for another’s sake but for our own. Only the smallest and most trivial part of wickedness redounds on other people; the worst and, as I might say, densest part of it stays at home and weighs on the one who owns it, just as our Attalus used to say: “Moral evil drinks the greater portion of its own poison.” But the poison we’re discussing is not like the one used by snakes, harmful to others yet causing no harm to the snake; *this* one is most damaging to those who possess it. The ingrate tortures and lashes himself; he hates what he has received because he will have to repay it, and in his mind he diminishes the gift while expanding and increasing the injuries he has received. What’s more wretched than a person to whom injuries cling while gifts and good deeds fall away?

But wisdom, on the other hand, lends beauty to every gift, commits it to her own care, and delights in constant recollection of it. Evil people get only a single pleasure, and it’s a brief one, lasting only as long as they’re receiving the gifts. For the sage, a long and lasting joy, arising from these gifts, remains firm. He delights not in getting but in having gotten, an immortal and unceasing thing. He shows disdain for the things that have wounded him, and forgets them, not out of negligence but intentionally. He doesn’t look at the downside of everything nor seek to assign blame, but rather attributes people’s faults to their bad luck. He doesn’t take amiss the words he hears or the looks he gets, but makes light of whatever went wrong by a kindly interpretation.

\[27\] It’s impossible to be grateful except by having disregard for the things that excite the mob. If you want to show gratitude, you must go into exile, shed blood, endure poverty, and have your very innocence frequently stained and subjected to unworthy rumors. It costs not a little for a grateful man to stay true to himself.

We think nothing more dear than a gift or good deed while we are seeking it, and nothing more worthless after we’ve obtained it. You ask what it is that makes us forgetful of what we’ve gotten? The desire of getting more. We hold in mind not what’s been attained but what we still need to ask for. Riches, political offices, power, and other things that seem dear in public opinion, but are worthless when valued for their own sake, drag us away from the path of right. We don’t know how to value things; we should think about them not according to their reputation but their inner nature. Those things I mentioned have nothing grand that should draw our thoughts to them, except this: We are used to being dazzled by them. They are not praised because they’re desirable but desired because they’re praised. Our individual errors of judgment lead to a mass error, and that mass error creates further errors in individuals.

But just as we’ve believed those ideas in the past, let’s now trust the same people on this: Nothing is more honorable than a grateful heart. All the cities of the world join in proclaiming this, even all the peoples who live in barbarian lands. The good and the wicked agree on this. Some there will be who praise pleasure, others who prefer hard work; some will call pain the greatest evil, others will deny that it *is* an evil; one person will include wealth among the highest goods, another will say it was discovered only to become a bane to human life, and that nothing is wealthier than the person to whom Fortune finds nothing she can give. Amid this great diversity of values, all people will affirm to you, as it were with a single voice, that gratitude must be shown to those who have done good deeds. The argumentative mob will agree on this, while, in the meantime, we continue to return injuries instead of benefits, and the principal cause of ingratitude is that it’s impossible to be grateful enough.

Our madness has reached this extreme: It’s become a very dangerous thing to bestow great benefits on someone, since if the recipient thinks it’s shameful not to repay, he’ll want no one around to whom repayment is owed. “Keep what you’ve gotten; I don’t want it back, I don’t demand it; let my assistance to you remain a safe thing.” No source of hatred is more destructive than the shame of a gift that’s been trampled on.





EPISTULAE MORALES LXXXI





\[19\] Omnia facienda sunt, ut quam gratissimi simus. Nostrum enim hoc bonum est, quemadmodum iustitia non est, ut vulgo creditur, ad alios pertinens; magna pars eius in se redit. Nemo non, cum alteri prodest, sibi profuit, non eo nomine dico, quod volet adiuvare adiutus, protegere defensus, quod bonum exemplum circuitu ad facientem revertitur, sicut mala exempla reddunt in auctores nec ulla miseratio contingit iis, qui patiuntur iniurias, quas posse fieri faciendo docuerunt, sed quod virtutum omnium pretium in ipsis est. Non enim exercentur ad praemium; recte facti fecisse merces est.

Gratus sum, non ut alius mihi libentius praestet priore irritatus exemplo, sed ut rem iucundissimam ac pulcherrimam faciam. Gratus sum, non quia expedit, sed quia iuvat. Hoc ut scias ita esse, si gratum esse non licebit, nisi ut videar ingratus, si reddere beneficium non aliter quam per speciem iniuriae potero, aequissimo animo ad honestum consilium per mediam infamiam tendam. Nemo mihi videtur pluris aestimare virtutem, nemo illi magis esse devotus quam qui boni viri famam perdidit, ne conscientiam perderet. Itaque, ut dixi, maiori tuo quam alterius bono gratus es. Illi enim vulgaris et cottidiana res contigit, recipere, quod dederat; tibi magna et ex beatissimo animi statu profecta, gratum fuisse. Nam si malitia miseros facit, virtus beatos, gratum autem esse virtus est, rem usitatam reddidisti, inaestimabilem consecutus es, conscientiam grati, quae nisi in animum divinum fortunatumque non pervenit.

Contrarium autem huic affectum summa infelicitas urget. Nemo sibi gratus est qui alteri non fuit. Hoc me putas dicere, qui ingratus est miser erit? Non differo illum: statim miser est.

Itaque ingrati esse vitemus, non aliena causa, sed nostra. Minimum ex nequitia levissimumque ad alios redundat. Quod pessimum ex illa est et, ut ita dicam, spississimum, domi remanet et premit habentem, quemadmodum Attalus noster dicere solebat: “Malitia ipsa maximam partem veneni sui bibit.” Illud venenum quod serpentes in alienam perniciem proferunt, sine sua continent, non est huic simile; hoc habentibus pessimum est. Torquet ingratus se et macerat; odit, quae accepit, quia redditurus est, et extenuat, iniurias vero dilatat atque auget. Quid autem eo miserius, cui beneficia excidunt, haerent iniuriae?

At contra sapientia exornat omne beneficium ac sibi ipsa commendat et se adsidua eius commemoratione delectat. Malis una voluptas est et haec brevis, dum accipiunt beneficia, ex quibus sapienti longum gaudium manet ac perenne. Non enim illum accipere, sed accepisse delectat, quod inmortale est et adsiduum. Illa contemnit, quibus laesus est, nec obliviscitur per neglegentiam, sed volens. Non vertit omnia in peius nec quaerit, cui imputet casum, et peccata hominum ad fortunam potius refert. Non calumniatur verba nec vultus; quicquid accidit, benigne interpretando levat.

\[27\] Nemo autem gratus esse potest, nisi contempsit ista, propter quae vulgus insanit; si referre vis gratiam, et in exilium eundum est et effundendus sanguis et suscipienda egestas et ipsa innocentia saepe maculanda indignisque obicienda rumoribus. Non parvo sibi constat homo gratus.

Nihil carius aestimamus quam beneficium, quamdiu petimus, nihil vilius, cum accepimus. Quaeris quid sit, quod oblivionem nobis acceptorum faciat? Cupiditas accipiendorum. Cogitamus non quid impetratum, sed quid petendum sit. Abstrahunt a recto divitiae, honores, potentia et cetera quae opinione nostra cara sunt, pretio suo vilia. Nescimus aestimare res, de quibus non cum fama, sed cum rerum natura deliberandum est; nihil habent ista magnificum quo mentes in se nostras trahant praeter hoc, quod mirari illa consuevimus. Non enim, quia concupiscenda sunt, laudantur, sed concupiscuntur, quia laudata sunt, et cum singulorum error publicum fecerit, singulorum errorem facit publicus.

Sed quemadmodum illa credidimus, sic et hoc eidem populo credamus, nihil esse grato animo honestius. Omnes hoc urbes, omnes etiam ex barbaris regionibus gentes conclamabunt. In hoc bonis malisque conveniet. Erunt qui voluptates laudent, erunt qui labores malint; erunt qui dolorem maximum malum dicant, erunt qui ne malum quidem appellent; divitias aliquis ad summum bonum admittet, alius illas dicet malo vitae humanae repertas, nihil esse eo locupletius cui quod donet fortuna non invenit. In tanta iudiciorum diversitate referendam bene merentibus gratiam omnes tibi uno, quod aiunt, ore affirmabunt. In hoc tam discors turba consentiet; cum interim iniurias pro beneficiis reddimus, et prima causa est cur quis ingratus sit, si satis gratus esse non potuit.

Eo perductus est furor, ut periculosissima res sit beneficia in aliquem magna conferre; nam quia putat turpe non reddere, non vult esse, cui reddat. Tibi habe quod accepisti; non repeto, non exigo. Profuisse tutum sit. Nullum est odium perniciosius quam e beneficii violati pudore.





NOTES





  1.   Book, chapter, and \(sometimes\) section numbers given in this edition enable readers to reference the Latin text. They also provide a guide to my excerptions; a new number appears wherever a stretch of text has been skipped in the move to a new selection. The use of a section number \(for example, the “9” in “1.1.9”\) indicates that the selection begins in the middle of a chapter of Seneca’s text.

  2.   The Latin word *animus*, often rendered “mind,” is here often translated “heart” because Seneca uses it to refer to the seat of emotions as well as of thoughts.

  3.   Throughout this essay, Seneca contrasts the moral dimensions of *giving* with those of *lending* or conducting business transactions; usually he differentiates the two, but here, in this first comparison, he stresses a point that they ought to share in common.

  4.   Throughout his essays, Seneca pauses to allow an unnamed person to voice dissent, sometimes introducing this person as “you,” at other times “he,” at still other times “someone,” or, as in this passage, offering no introduction at all. Seneca immediately launches into his counterargument as soon as this objector has had a say.

  5.   Seneca here verbally transforms *beneficium*, normally thought of as the thing given, into the act of giving; the “gift” is only a by-product.

  6.   A line quoted, with slight adaptation, from Vergil’s *Georgics* \(4.132\).

  7.   During the civil wars that plagued the Roman state in the century before Seneca’s, strongmen used proscription as a way to eliminate enemies. Someone who was proscribed—that is, posted on a public blacklist—could be killed by any citizen in exchange for a reward.

  8.   The sexism of this sentence has been allowed to stand, though of course Seneca’s contemporaries would find nothing objectionable in it.

  9.   Employed in hunting wild game.

10.   Seneca speaks as one who knows, since he was serving as Nero’s chief minister during the time this work was written.

11.   A Greek philosopher of the third century BC.

12.   “Newspapers” is a mild anachronism, but the *acta diurna* that Seneca here refers to—placards put up each day in the Roman forum—served more or less the same purpose.

13.   On proscription, see note 7. The men of the so-called Second Triumvirate—Octavian \(later called Augustus\), Marc Antony, and Lepidus—used this method to solidify their control of Rome in the wars following Julius Caesar’s assassination.

14.   Seneca compares the donor’s exhibition of the beneficiary to a conquering general’s display of prisoners in a triumphal procession through the streets of Rome.

15.   Romans of high status could obtain snow for cooling their drinks; this was brought down from the high mountain slopes by runners.

16.   There were two kings named Antigonus in Hellenistic Greece, both fabulously wealthy; the story told here might concern either. A talent of silver contained 6,000 drachmas, a very large sum. Cynic philosophers disdained money and went about in ragged cloaks, begging from passers-by. The denarius mentioned in the following is a Roman coin of small value.

17.   A risky sentiment for Seneca, who often adopted a Cynic pose in his disdain for wealth, yet accrued one of the greatest fortunes of his time.

18.   Chrysippus, a Greek philosopher of the Stoic school, is here called “our,” since Seneca and his fellow Stoics considered him a kindred spirit.

19.   These coveted political offices are here mentioned in ascending order.

20.   Meaning, perhaps, the gods conceived as a collective. The word *parens* used here can be feminine, but Seneca gives it masculine gender.

21.   The great sculptor and architect of classical Athens, responsible for much of the Parthenon.

22.   It’s not uncommon for Seneca \(or other ancient authors\) to speak of “god” \(*deus*\) in the singular, though of course he believed that this unified divine mind was manifested in a plurality of beings.

23.   Elaborately decorated ceilings were a mark of high luxury in Seneca’s day.

24.   This line \(and several others omitted here\) is quoted from Vergil’s first *Georgic*, where the “god” referred to is in fact Augustus Caesar.

25.   Here and in the following, “fellowship” very imperfectly translates Latin *societas*, a word of far larger scope. When used by philosophic authors like Seneca, *societas* denotes the human impulse for aggregation and communal life.

26.   I follow here the emended text of M. C. Gertz, who inserted a second iteration of *ingrati sunt*.

27.   A difficult sentence. Seneca’s point is that gratitude must begin with piety, for if we can’t feel grateful toward the gods, with their perfect generosity, we’ll never feel grateful toward our fellow human beings \(“those who can be thanked only by outlay of expense”\).

28.   The train of thought is difficult, but amounts to: Let’s overlook ingratitude, for if we treat others as though they *were* grateful, they’re more likely to become so.

29.   Elsewhere Seneca takes pains to distinguish giving from lending, but here he establishes a parallel.

30.   The metaphor is of a snarled piece of thread. Following M. Haupt’s emendation, I have here adopted the insertion of the word *violentia* into the text.

31.   An interesting glimpse of the perils of social relations among the Roman elite: Seneca speculates that someone who owes a debt to a high-status benefactor, if pressed too hard, might spread evil rumors as a way to take revenge or avoid payment. At the end of his *Epistle 81* \(see the following chapter\), he even implies that the debtor might have his creditor killed.
