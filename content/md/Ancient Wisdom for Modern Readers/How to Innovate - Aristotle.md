# PREFACE





It used to be said that the ancient Greeks were not keen on innovation. That view was based on a partial and insufficiently discerning interpretation of the evidence of ancient writings, and historians now recognize that the Greeks were never as disinclined to innovate as had been assumed. In fact, what requires explanation is the conspicuously innovative achievement that has always been recognized as a feature of ancient Greek society. Certain conditions, fertile for innovation, must have allowed for the range of inventions and discoveries that makes ancient Greek culture so influential for its inheritors in subsequent generations.

In addition to these conditions, various mechanisms can be seen to underlie their innovative practices: mechanisms such as the borrowing and adaptation of external ideas, the cross-fertilizing of disparate disciplines, and the posing of disruptive critiques to the ideas and practices of their predecessors.

These principles of innovation were not systematically formulated by the Greeks themselves. They emerge from various writings that address the notion of innovation in different ways. The format of this book therefore, while taking a single and overridingly influential author, Aristotle, to provide the central texts, adduces other less well known ancient sources to illustrate innovations that represent the key mechanisms of the Greeks’ innovative practices.

## Note on the Texts

For ease of matching translation to the original, I have divided up the texts of Aristotle and Athenaeus into shorter paragraphs and provided a new alphabetic numeration for each section. The numbering and structure of the texts of Diodorus is that of the standard scholarly editions. I have aimed to create translations that are both accurate and readable, using the Greek texts \(with a few minor variants\) of the Loeb Classical Library editions.



 





# INTRODUCTION





Innovation is the driving force of the modern world. In technology, politics, business, art, music, academia, the military, and countless other areas of life, change is constant, and the search for novelty is unremitting. Responses to change range from excitement to fear; change means loss, and when things are changing fast there can be little time to digest what has been lost and to embrace the new. While some may feel a pressure to be innovative, others are perplexed about the meaning of innovation and the value of the new. What is innovation, and how is one to think about creating change?

Athens in the archaic and classical period \(around 800 to 300 BCE\) was a fast-changing society in which the idea of innovation was, for the first time in the written record, explicitly raised and discussed. The earliest use of a word for forging something new \(Greek *kainotomia*\) is found in a comic play by the dramatist Aristophanes, dating from the late fifth century BCE. While it’s often said that the ancient Greeks were averse to novelty and reluctant to innovate, their writings show that in a range of disciplines they were well aware of the power and advantages of the new. “I don’t sing the old songs, my new songs are better,” run the lines of some lyrics composed by the singer-songwriter Timotheus of Miletus in the late fifth century BCE. A similar promotion of novelty can be found in many other fields of activity and intellectual pursuits of the period.

Despite largely conducting their lives within the bounds of a traditional agrarian society, the classical Greeks were responsible for creating a series of world-changing innovations. Early in the period of their efflorescence they invented the alphabet, by borrowing and adapting letterforms used in the Near Eastern nation of Phoenicia; and the Greek alphabet, as further adapted by the Romans, has been central to communication ever since. They went on to invent philosophy, logic, rhetoric, and mathematical proof; to be the first practitioners of theatrical drama, rational medicine, monetary coinage, and lifelike sculpture; and to create competitive athletics, architectural canons, the self-governing city-state \(*polis*\), and democratic politics.

These transformative cultural changes, which took place over the five centuries from 800 to 300 BCE, cannot have happened by accident. None of the Greeks’ creations nor the products thereof, some of which have never been surpassed, could have come into being without the contributions of individuals who created and operated in conditions fertile for change, who were prepared and keen to innovate, and who understood how to exploit the means of doing so.

Some Greeks also sought to understand the conditions that made innovation possible; and descriptions of the creative procedures that led to many of the Greeks’ novel achievements are preserved in their writings. What surviving texts illustrate is that, while the processes of creativity are potentially endless, the creation of the new relies on a few basic principles: notably, the adaptation of existing elements, the cross-fertilization of disparate entities, and the disruption of previous conditions. On these principles and combinations of them, change was created in practice for centuries. It inspired the earliest Greek thinkers from the sixth century BCE to ask questions such as “where does everything come from?” and “what is change?” Toward the end of the classical period, Aristotle \(384–322 BCE\) sought to analyze the logic of change on different levels, natural, metaphysical, and political.

Aristotle’s theoretical analysis of change in *Physics* book 1 begins by refuting the counterintuitive notion proposed by predecessors such as Parmenides that change itself is impossible. He goes on to argue that all change requires a preexisting situation or substrate from which change can and must proceed. His argument may be generalized to affirm that the new depends on the old, a position summarized in *Physics* book 1. Aristotle was keen to understand change in practice as well as in theory. The key political unit of the Greek world of his time was the polis \(independent citizen-run state\): around a thousand existed in the classical period. How the polis might best be organized is the focus of the philosopher’s discussion in his *Politics* book 2. There Aristotle discusses and critiques the governments of some existing states and considers blueprints for new kinds of government, such as those proposed by Socrates in Plato’s *Republic* and Plato in his *Laws*, as well as examining the innovative constitutional proposals of less well known political theorists.

The novelty in thought and action generated by the Greek city-states of classical times laid the basis for the artistic, intellectual, and scientific discoveries, some two millennia later, of the European Renaissance. Writers and artists in that period of rebirth supposed that they were engaged in a recreation of Greek ideas in science, art, music, and many other fields. A large part of the education offered in Renaissance universities involved the interpretation of Aristotle’s works and the study of his ancient commentators. It made sense for thinkers then, and it still makes sense today, to look to the great philosopher of antiquity to deepen our understanding about, among other things, the principles of change.

The two longest texts chosen for this book, taken from Aristotle’s *Physics* 1 and *Politics* 2 to accompany the first and last chapters, respectively present the philosopher’s closely argued theoretical analysis of change and his extensive criticism of proposals for innovation in the sphere of politics. Aristotle’s discussion of the logic of change and variation in *Physics* argues that change can be understood only in relation to a persistent underlying element. His treatment of “constitutions” in *Politics* 2 considers in detail, and levels criticisms at, existing forms of government and at theoretical attempts to devise new kinds of government for the polis. It concludes with the brief but important observation that the value of innovation differs depending on the domain in which it is applied.

In addition to these, a selection of shorter Greek texts from antiquity are appended to the intervening chapters to illustrate ancient accounts of particular instances of the creation of change:

Chapter 2: The description of the ship *Syracusia*, recorded in detail by the second-century CE author of *The Learned Banqueters*, Athenaeus of Naucratis. This project required Archimedes to discover his innovative formulation of the principle of buoyancy, which may be argued to underlie the famous story of his “Eureka moment.”

Chapter 3: An account of the contrarian strategy of the general Epaminondas at the Battle of Leuctra in 371 BCE. The story of the Theban commander’s success in using the tactics of an “oblique phalanx” is recounted by the Sicilian historian in *The Library of History*, Diodorus Siculus.

Chapter 4: The report of a competition set up by the king Dionysius of Syracuse in early fourth-century Sicily, which led to the invention of new weapons such as the catapult, also by Diodorus Siculus.



 





HOW TO INNOVATE

# Principles of Change

The question of change was of consuming interest to the earliest Greek natural philosophers, who flourished in the cities of Ionia \(modern western Turkey\) in the sixth century BCE. Where did everything come from? they asked. Can something come from nothing? It seemed clear enough that nothing can come from nothing. But for some this meant that there can therefore be no starting point, no absolute beginning or first moment of creation; while for others \(Parmenides and the Eleatic school\) it suggested, counterintuitively to experience, that there was no possibility of genesis or change at all.

Traditional Greek myths proposed that everything began from a transcendent starting point such as a god or supernatural element. The notion of an eternal regress was unappealing to most Greeks; and the wholesale denial of change contradicted the phenomena of daily life. From observation of the world around them, the earliest thinkers sought a different, nonmythical, solution to the question of the “first principle” \(*archē*\). Many of these thinkers, who were called in their time “physical” philosophers \(i.e., students of nature, *physis*\), came up with variations of the idea that the universe in all its multiplicity must have arisen from a single natural element that underlies all creation.

What could that prime element be? The first “physical philosopher” to be identified by Aristotle, Thales of Miletus, claimed that it was water. The fact that water is essential to life, growth, and health, and is found in visibly different forms—liquid, vapor, snow, and ice—makes it a plausible choice. But subsequent thinkers declared that there must be a yet more fundamental element: Anaximenes identified it as air; Heraclitus thought it was fire. A different kind of solution was proposed by Anaximander, who argued that the origin of everything was an abstract principle that he called “the Limitless.”

The choice of early philosophers to identify the ground of being with a single element \(on account of which these thinkers are called “monists”\) raised evident problems. How could any single element give rise to the different ones? How can water turn into fire, air into earth? Could “the Limitless” have given rise to any of these elements? In the early fifth century, Parmenides of Elea concluded that the very notion of change was illogical and illusory. His contemporary, the Sicilian Empedocles of Acragas, took a different view, proposing that four basic elements—water, air, fire, and earth—were fundamental to creation, and that the universe consists of innumerable transformations of these prime elements. Just as plants exist and grow by using all four elements earth, air, sun, and water, everything in the world must derive from these as they combine with and separate from each other: Empedocles named the combining force Love, and the separating force Strife.

Empedocles calls these elements the “roots” of the cosmos. On his account, the four fundamental roots of being interact to give rise to the myriad multiplicity of the universe. While the term “radical” innovation \(from the Latin for “root,” radix\) nowadays implies a novelty with no basis in what has gone earlier, logically \(as Aristotle was to affirm\) the new can arise only out of preexisting elements. “Radical” novelty, then, should not be used to designate something that is new roots and all, but only something that is new from the roots up. Figuratively speaking, the roots are hidden in the earth, while what’s new is the growth that is visible above the ground.

A generation after Empedocles, Democritus proposed that the universe is made from tiny particles that he called atoms \(from *atoma*, “indivisibles”\). On his theory, these are what combine to form the material world. His physical views were propagated by the third-century BCE philosopher Epicurus of Samos and were given magnificent expression in the great philosophical poem in Latin *De Rerum Natura* \(*On the Nature of Things*\) by the first-century BCE Roman poet Lucretius. Modern physics agrees with Democritus, but his theory didn’t seize the popular imagination in ancient times. For millennia after Empedocles, people found it easier to suppose that everything in the universe was a product of the four elements he had identified and their infinite combinations.

In the fourth century BCE, Aristotle followed the philosophical teachings of Plato with physical and scientific as well as ethical investigations, in which he sought to articulate and analyze the notions of change and innovation in various domains, in particular those of the natural world and the arena of politics and society. Aristotle’s discussion of physical change in *Physics* is characteristically spare and dry since he was concerned to present rigorously compelling arguments. His discussion, the tone of which the chosen selection gives a flavor, refutes Parmenides’s negation of change by arguing that coming-to-be requires positing an underlying entity \(“what is”\). From this a new structure emerges, which both relates to the previous entity and alters it. For purposes of creating something new, the key point that arises from this discussion is that, in practice as well as in logic, change cannot take place without the existence of some underlying thing that will be the subject of that change.

 





## The Logic of Change

*Physics 1, Chapter 8, 191a23–b34*

\[A\] The earliest philosophers were misled in their search for truth and the nature of things by their naive outlook, which led them down a blind alley. They claimed that nothing can either come to be or cease to be, on the grounds that what comes to be must do so either from what is or from what is not. In their view neither of these is possible, since on the one hand what exists cannot come into existence because it already exists, and on the other nothing can come into existence from nothing—there must be something preexistent. They took the consequence of this to extremes, concluding that a plurality of things cannot exist, but only being itself.

\[B\] This was what they argued, and the reason for their conclusions; but I would explain it thus. For something to come from what is or from what is not, or for either of the latter to act, be acted on, or become an identifiable thing, is akin to a doctor doing something, having something done to him, or being or becoming something from being a doctor. These propositions about the doctor can be understood in different ways, just as can the propositions about something “becoming from what is,” and “doing something or having something done to.”

\[C\] If a doctor builds a house, he does so not in his capacity as a doctor, but as a builder. If he becomes gray haired, he does so not in his capacity as a doctor but as someone who was previously dark haired. However, if he administers medicine, or fails to do so correctly, he does this in his capacity as a doctor. It’s appropriate to say that a doctor does something, or undergoes something, or becomes something from being a doctor, only if it is as a doctor that he does, undergoes, or becomes something else. It’s clear, then, that we should say the same thing about coming to be something from what-is-not, which is to say, that this means from what-is-not in the capacity of what-is-not.

\[D\] Failure to make this distinction led thinkers astray, until they came to suppose that nothing comes to be or exists apart from what it is itself; so they ruled out coming-to-be altogether. While I agree that nothing can be said in an unqualified sense to come from what is not, I say that a thing may in a qualified sense come to be from what is not, that is, by happenstance. The reason is that a thing comes to be from a lack of being something. That lack is by nature something that is not, which does not persist in the event of change. This is what puzzles people who think it impossible that something should come to be from what is not.

\[E\] In the same way nothing can come from what is and nothing can come to be what is, except by happenstance. That is how something comes to be, as when an animal comes to be from an animal, and an animal of a particular kind from an animal of a particular kind—dog from dog, or horse from horse. A dog would then come to be from an animal as well as from a particular animal, but as it already has the property of being an animal it does not *become* an animal. If anything is to become an animal, where being an animal is not just a coincidental property, it will not do so from already being an animal. If something is to become something that is, it cannot do so from something that it is already. Nor can it come from what-is-not, because \(as I have explained\) “from what-is-not” means “from something that is not in the capacity of what-is-not.” This allows us to preserve the principle that everything either is or is not.

\[F\] This is one way of resolving the problem. Another consists in showing how the same things can be spoken of in terms of potentiality and actuality, as I have done in detail elsewhere.

\[G\] So, to conclude, I have now resolved the difficulties that forced people to rule out some of the things I have argued are the case. This was what led some earlier thinkers to misconstrue totally the question of coming to be, ceasing to be, and change generally. If they had grasped the point of this underlying nature, their misunderstandings would have been dispelled.

# The Conditions of Creation

The fourth century BCE saw the greatest contributions to philosophical thought in Western history, the works of Plato and his pupil Aristotle. Aristotle was to reject much of his teacher’s idealistic thought, and to create a logical and empirical approach that has influenced all subsequent thinking. Covering a vast domain of science, ethics, and metaphysics, Aristotelian philosophy dominated study in late antiquity, the early Islamic world, and medieval Europe. But the greatest technical inventor of antiquity lived and worked in the century after Aristotle. He was Archimedes of Syracuse, a Greek from the island of Sicily, and the story of his “Eureka moment” has resonated across the millennia.

The lesson of the Eureka moment is that certain conditions can help to stimulate the spark of innovative thought. Just as water is a condition for the flourishing of life, the right conditions are needed for creativity to flourish. These conditions may be external or internal, collective or individual, social or personal.

History gives abundant examples of creativity flourishing in circumstances where new ideas are socially encouraged and rewarded. Innovations are made when people enjoy the freedom and resources to think creatively, when opportunities exist to disseminate ideas with ease and rapidity, and when personal, social, and financial incentives are present. Such conditions are unevenly distributed in the world today and have only rarely existed in history. But, at various times and places in the ancient Greek world, the necessary conditions prevailed.

People find their own ways of exploiting such conditions to harness their creativity. Inventors are often pictured as single-minded individuals, whose immersion in their projects leads to creative achievements. But to allow creative connections to emerge successfully, thinkers need to get “into the flow.” One way of doing so is by stepping back and shifting perspective.

Innumerable creators and problem solvers have testified that the path to creative experience has meant first deeply engaging with, and then stepping back from, their object of inquiry. Concentration needs to be offset by diversion to allow new perspectives to emerge and creative ideas to emerge. The story of Archimedes’s Eureka moment offers an illustration of how creating the right conditions may have led to his most memorable intellectual innovation, the formulation of the “Archimedes Principle.”

## ***Archimedes’s Bath*

As told by the Roman author Vitruvius in the first century BCE, the story goes that the ruler of Syracuse, Hieron, had set Archimedes a challenge. Hieron had commissioned the manufacture of a crown of pure gold, but after receiving it he suspected that the craftsman had purloined some of the gold by adulterating it with another material. Hieron wanted to find out whether the crown was made of solid gold but was unsure about how the composition of the finely wrought object could be assessed. In the ancient world, assayers regularly used procedures such as scratching the surface of a metal to reveal a particular color or sheen, or chiseling bits off to weigh and measure them, but such methods could not be used in this case without damaging the crown.

It was clear that, had the craftsman mixed in some lighter metal with the gold or left hollows in its structure, the crown would weigh less than if it were solid gold. But simply knowing its weight would not give the required answer. Without constructing an identical crown in solid gold, weight alone could not be used to reveal the crown’s composition. What was needed was to discover its density—its weight relative to its volume—and to compare this with the density of pure gold. The question was how one might accurately measure the density of such an object.

One evening, as Archimedes sank into a bath, he observed the way in which the waterline rose as the bulk of his body displaced the water, causing water to spill over the rim of the tub. The solution struck him: the volume of an object could be measured by measuring the amount of water it displaced. An object of identical weight to his body but made of far denser material, such as a block of pure gold, would displace much less water than his body did. If he weighed the crown and compared how much water was displaced by the same weight of pure gold, he could show whether the crown was as dense as the gold. Archimedes leapt from the bath, the story goes, and ran naked through the streets of Syracuse yelling “Eureka,” the Greek for “I’ve got it\!” As a result, the term “Eureka moment” has entered the English language to refer to the moment of insight when a solution emerges.

### *Switch Off, Step Back*

As told by Vitruvius about two hundred years after the event, the Eureka story is memorably dramatic. It was also given a satisfying conclusion: after Archimedes’s measurements proved that the craftsman had in fact pilfered Hieron’s gold, Archimedes was handsomely rewarded, and the miscreant was punished. But the traditional story is open to question. It’s not clear how Archimedes’s solution to the question of how to measure the volume of a crown could have been achieved in practice, or that the principle of calculating density \(as a function of weight and volume\) was Archimedes’s discovery.

We might imagine, however, that after struggling to find a solution to a knotty problem, Archimedes went to the baths to relax. At such a juncture, the brain switches into a different gear. Neurochemical processes alter, mental perspectives shift, and solutions fall into place. So it may be that when Archimedes’s solution occurred to him, it had less to do with his observing the way his body displaced water in a bathtub than with the fact of his going to the bathhouse to relax.

### ***A Floating Palace*

This experience, well documented for modern inventors and innovators, may be the real lesson of Archimedes’s Eureka moment. Having immersed himself in the problem, Archimedes switched off and was rewarded with a flash of enlightenment. And history provides a neglected clue that the density of a gold crown was not the issue for which he found a solution. The Syracusans were famous for having invented a range of military artillery and weaponry, such as the catapult and the ballista \(see chapter 3\); and from the early fourth century BCE on, the city’s successive rulers had also commissioned the construction of some of the largest floating vessels known to the ancient world. Descendants of these seagoing vessels, the giant cargo ships used to import grain to the growing population of Rome, have been uncovered by marine archaeologists. Two spectacularly lavish vessels recovered from Lake Nemi in 1929 have be identified with the ships described by the historian Suetonius as having been constructed for the Roman emperor Caligula in the first century CE, “with poops blazing with jewels and multicolored sails, fitted with luxurious baths, galleries, and dining rooms, and supplied with a variety of vines and other fruit trees.”

Archimedes was already a maritime inventor who had devised ship-borne weapons such as a giant claw for lifting enemy boats bodily out of the water, and an arrangement of mirrors that focused a beam of light that allegedly could set ships on fire. The fact that the Eureka moment might have had something to do with Archimedes pondering a question of maritime importance is suggested in the writings of a second-century CE author, Athenaeus of Naucratis \(in Egypt\), who records Archimedes’s design and construction at the commission of Hieron of a gigantic ship called the *Syracusia* after the name of his city, Syracuse.

Fifty times the size of a standard warship, the *Syracusia* was the largest ship ever constructed in the ancient world. The detailed report by Athenaeus, quoting an unknown writer Moschion, tells us that it was built to carry a cargo of up to eighteen hundred tons, and could accommodate over a thousand on board. The uppermost deck held eight watchtowers manned by soldiers, and on the ship’s bow was a raised platform with a massive catapult capable of propelling 180-pound rocks. It had a promenade lined with flowers, a library, a gymnasium, and a temple to the goddess Aphrodite. It was so vast that the Egyptian harbor of Alexandria was the only port large enough to receive it.

Archimedes needed to answer the obvious question regarding this prodigious vessel: will it float? He had to prove to himself, if not to Hieron, that a ship of such enormous proportions, complex construction, and unprecedented weight was not going to sink. It seems likely that what struck Archimedes as he relaxed in the baths was a principle of great practical value, still essential for mechanical engineers today: the principle of buoyancy that states that an immersed object is buoyed up by a force equal to the weight of the fluid it displaces. If the object’s overall weight is greater than that force, it will sink; if not, it will float. This equation explains why a steel supertanker floats no less surely than a rowboat. It is hard not to see a connection between the report of the building of the *Syracusia* and Archimedes’s Eureka moment: the law of buoyancy, so crucial for shipbuilding, is still known as the Archimedes Principle.

 





## The Eureka Imperative

*Athenaeus Book 5, 206d5–209e2*

\[A\] The construction of the ship built by Hieron of Syracuse, overseen by the mathematician Archimedes, is worthy of commemoration. Moschion has published a book on it, which I recently read with care.

Moschion writes as follows:

\[B\] Hieron, the king of Syracuse, who was always a friend to Rome, not only engaged in the construction of temples and gymnasia but was keen to be known as a shipbuilder, with the construction of massive transport ships. Here I describe the construction of one of these.

\[C\] The material for its construction was wood procured from Etna, in sufficient quantity for the building of sixty quadriremes. Hieron arranged for wooden pegs, belly timbers, rib timbers, and whatever material was needed for other uses to come partly from Italy and partly from Sicily. He procured esparto from Spain for cables, hemp and pitch from the Rhone valley, and other necessary materials from many different places. He recruited shipwrights and other craftsmen and appointed the Corinthian Archias as foreman, commanding him to set about the construction with dispatch, and spending his own days on the project.

\[D\] Half the ship was completed in six months, and as each section was built it was sheathed with lead. About three hundred craftsmen worked on the materials, not counting their assistants. This part of the ship was ordered to be pulled down to the sea so that the rest of the work could be done there. After lengthy discussions about how to pull it down to the water, Archimedes the engineer arranged to do so, using a few laborers for the task. It was only by constructing a screw windlass, which was an invention of Archimedes, that it was possible to move a hull of such enormous size down to the sea.

\[E\] The remainder of the ship was completed in another six months. It was secured by bronze rivets, mostly ten pounds in weight, with others weighing fifteen pounds, which were set in their place with the use of augers, to fasten the ribs together. The rivets were covered by lead sheathing fastened to the timber hull, padded by strips of linen covered with pitch.

\[F\] When the ship’s exterior was complete, Archimedes started work on the interior. The ship was constructed to hold twenty banks of rowers and had three decks. The lowest deck consisted of a cargo area, which was reached by a long flight of shallow steps. The central deck was for the crew’s quarters. The uppermost deck was for the use of armed guards. Around the central deck were thirty cabins, each eight square meters in area, ranged around both sides of the ship. The captain’s quarters were eighteen square meters in area, consisting of three cabins each of six square meters. A cabin was constructed toward the stern for the kitchen galley.

\[G\] All these cabins had a mosaic floors made from a variety of stones, arranged to amazing effect to depict the whole story of the *Iliad*, and the furniture, ceilings, and doors were also elaborately worked. The uppermost deck contained a gymnasium, and boardwalks in proportion to the size of the ship, in which were planted colorful flowerbeds brimming with flowers, which were watered by concealed lead piping. There were screens of ivy and grapevines, the roots of which were nourished by barrels filled with earth, and which were watered in the same way as the flowerbeds. These screens were used to give shade to the boardwalks.

\[H\] Adjoining these was a six-square-meter temple to Aphrodite, with a floor made of agate and other precious stones from Sicily. Its walls and ceiling were made from cypress wood, and its doors of ivory and cedar. It was sumptuously furnished with paintings, statues, and drinking vessels of all kinds.

\[I\] Adjoining the temple to Aphrodite was a ten-square-meter library with walls and doors made of boxwood, containing a collection of books. On its ceiling was a concave sundial constructed on the model of the sundial in Achradina. There was also a six-square-meter bathroom containing three bronze bathtubs and a fifty-gallon washstand made of variegated Tauromenian marble. There were also rooms for the marines and for the crew that manned the bilge pumps.

\[J\] In addition to these rooms, on each side of the ship there were ten stalls for horses. Adjoining them was the store for fodder and for the equipment used by the riders and grooms. There was also a covered twenty-thousand-gallon water tank near the prow made from planks of wood caulked with pitch and linen. Next to it was a covered fish tank made from lead and wooden planks, filled with seawater and stocked with fish.

\[K\] On both sides of the ship there were beams projecting at regular intervals holding containers with wood, ovens, roasting spits, hand mills, and various other appliances. Around the ship ran a row of Atlas statues three meters high, spaced at intervals to support the roof and upper decks. The whole ship was decorated with bespoke paintings.

\[L\] There were eight watchtowers symmetrically arranged around the deck, two at the stern, two at the bow, and four amidship. Each had two booms attached to them, on which were fitted crates from which boulders could be dropped at enemy vessels sailing beneath. The watchtowers were each manned by four men in full armor and two archers, and were stocked with missiles.

\[M\] Along the length of the ship ran a wall with battlements and a decking supported on trestles, on which stood a ballista devised by Archimedes that could fire a 180-pound boulder or an eighteen-foot missile to a distance of six hundred feet. In front of this were hung leather drapes suspended by bronze chains.

\[N\] The ship had three masts, each of which had two booms from which grappling hooks could be lowered and lumps of lead dropped onto attackers. An iron palisade encircled the ship to protect against any attempts at boarding. Around the top deck iron hooks were stowed, which could be fired from catapults to grasp the hulls of enemy vessels and pull them alongside so as to expose them to attack.

\[O\] Sixty soldiers in armor were stationed on each side of the ship, and sixty others manned the masts and the booms that held the boulders. Guards were also stationed on the bronze mast tops, three on the foremast, two by the mainmast, and one on the mizzenmast. Slaves used pulleys to haul stones and missiles up to the crow’s nests in wicker baskets. There were four anchors of wood and eight of iron. The timber for the mainmast and mizzenmast was easily procured, but the tree used for the foremast was located only with difficulty in the mountains of Bruttium by a swineherd, and transported down to the sea by the engineer Phileas of Tauromenium. Although the bilge was very deep, it could easily be pumped out by one man using the water screw—another invention of Archimedes.

\[P\] The ship was named *Syracusia*, but when Hieron dispatched it as a gift he changed the name to *Alexandris*. It was accompanied by a flotilla of boats: an eighty-ton cargo galley propelled by oars, some forty-ton fishing boats, and a number of smaller vessels. The crew numbered no less than eight hundred: in addition to those mentioned, six hundred marines were posted and ready at the prow. For any crimes committed on board, a court composed of the captain, the navigator, and the officer at the bow dispensed judgment in accordance with the laws of Syracuse.

\[Q\] On board were loaded ninety thousand bushels of grain, ten thousand jars of Sicilian saltfish, six hundred tons of wool, and six hundred tons of other cargo, in addition to provisions stowed for the crew. When Hieron learned that existing harbors were either insufficiently large or too dangerous to receive the ship to port, he settled on sending it as a gift to King Ptolemy at Alexandria, as there happened to be a grain shortage in Egypt. This he did, and the ship sailed to Alexandria, where it was hauled into port.

\[R\] The poet Archimelus composed an epigram celebrating the vessel, and Hieron rewarded him with fifteen hundred bushels of wheat, which Archimelus had shipped at his own expense to the Peiraeus.

The epigram runs as follows:
>  
> Who set these giant timbers on the ground,

> what master hauled them with untiring ropes?

> How were these decks affixed to oaken ribs,

> what axes hewed the rivets for its hull?

> It looms like Etna’s peaks, or like an isle

> girt by th’ Aegean in the Cyclades,

> with walls of equal breadth on either side,

> for giants, surely, to traverse the skies\!

> Its mastheads touch the stars and raise aloft

> its threefold ramparts to the clouds on high,

> Its anchor ropes are such as Xerxes used

> to bind Abydos o’er to Sestos’s shore.

> These letters freshly painted on its prow

> declare who launched this keel from land to sea,

> proclaiming Hieron, son of Hierocles,

> the Dorian wielder of Sicilian power,

> who brings rich grain to Hellas and the isles.

> Through gray-flecked waves, Poseidon, guide her safe.

# The Principle of Disruption

“Expect the unexpected or you will not achieve it” is one of the cryptic comments preserved from the philosopher Heraclitus \(early fifth century BCE\). It makes sense in the context of innovation: if one wants to do something new, one has to be prepared to do the unexpected—in other words, to be a contrarian. The billionaire investor Warren Buffett has articulated this as follows: “A simple rule dictates my buying: Be fearful when others are greedy, and be greedy when others are fearful.” In creating change, there is value in thinking and acting in a way that does not follow the common trend, but opposes it.

Allied to this kind of contrarian thinking is “disruptive innovation,” whereby an improvement in a product or service is unexpected or unfamiliar but succeeds in superseding the traditional market. Henry Ford, inventor of the Model T Ford, famously declared, “I will build a car for the great multitude. It will be large enough for the family, but small enough for the individual to run and care for. It will be constructed of the best materials, by the best men to be hired, after the simplest designs that modern engineering can devise. But it will be so low in price that no man making a good salary will be unable to own one—and enjoy with his family the blessing of hours of pleasure in God’s great open spaces.” By organizing the mass production what had thitherto been a luxury item, Ford changed cars so completely that they rendered other forms of road transport obsolete.

 





## Turning the Tide of Battle

One of the most successful innovations in ancient Greek military history involved a disruptive strategy. From the accounts of ancient historians Xenophon, Plutarch, and Diodorus of Sicily \(text below\), we can piece together an account of the innovation that led to the Boeotian victory at Leuctra in 371 BCE under the command of the Theban general Epaminondas.

For centuries, Greek battles had been fought in almost identical fashion, with armies drawn up to face each other across a level plain. They advanced to the attack either when one side or other felt the time to be favorable, or when one side had had enough of standing around and waiting. Religious rituals and conventional forms of prayer and devotion before battle were heavily relied on to increase morale and ensure success. It was an unshakeable principle that the strongest fighters, the most highly respected troops, should be accorded the place of honor in the battle formation, which meant that they were disposed without fail on the right flank.

For centuries the Spartans had fielded the most highly trained warriors in Greece. They assumed that their powerful right flank would always break through the enemy lines. Once this was done, they would put in train a standard follow-up maneuver, wheeling around into their opponents’ lines and attacking them side on.

At Leuctra, the Boeotian allies led by Thebes were outnumbered by several thousand more Spartan infantry and cavalry. The Theban commander Epaminondas thinned the line even further, in order to mass his troops on the left flank at a hitherto unheard of depth of fifty ranks, headed up by the best-trained fighters, the Sacred Band of three hundred elite soldiers.

This led to an unexpected course of battle from the Spartan point of view. Their strongest fighters, those on their right flank under their king Cleombrotus, met irresistible opposition from the Thebans’ heavily reinforced left flank headed by the Sacred Band. Meanwhile, the Spartans on the left of their army found that the enemy in front of them, instead of putting up a fight, melted away as they attacked. Rather than ordering his right flank to fight, Epaminondas’s strategy was that they should give ground to the Spartan left wing.

The result of the tactic was twofold. On the Spartan’s strongest side, the unexpected force of resistance was baffling. As the heavily reinforced Thebans made headway on that flank, the Spartans in front of them were forced to retreat, with many dead. Meanwhile, on the other flank, the Spartans were finding their advance surprisingly easy because their opponents were yielding ground. But this meant that when the Thebans had secured the field on their left, they could attack the advancing Spartan soldiers from behind.

The outcome of the battle was a victory for Thebes over considerably greater forces, which made them the leaders of Greece for a decade until the death of Epaminondas in a second battle. Epaminondas’s strategy at the Battle of Leuctra has been held up as a classic model of creating change through contrarian tactics.

 





## A Winning Strategy

### *Diodorus,* Library *15.55–56.4*

#### 15.55

\[1\] On the Spartan side the Heraclid kings Cleombrotus and Archidamus son of Agesilaus were stationed as commanders of the wings. On the Theban side Epaminondas, by employing an unusual disposition of his own devising, managed through a unique strategy to achieve his famous victory.

\[2\] From the whole force he selected the strongest men and stationed them on one wing, intending to fight to the end alongside them. The weakest he placed on the other wing and instructed them to avoid engaging and to withdraw bit by bit as the enemy advanced. By arranging his phalanx in oblique formation, therefore, he planned so that the battle should be decided by the elite fighting wing.

\[3\] When the trumpets on both sides sounded and the armies raised the battle cry with their first charge, the Spartans attacked on both wings with their phalanx in crescent formation. The Thebans fell back on one wing, while on the other they engaged the enemy forces with a running charge.

\[4\] As they clashed hand to hand, at first both sides fought vigorously, and the battle was evenly poised. Soon, however, Epaminondas’s troops began to get the upper hand as a result of their strength and their densely reinforced column, and the Peloponnesians began to fall in great numbers. They were unable to withstand the weight of the intrepid elite corps, some of whom fell fighting while others sustained frontal wounds since at no point did they turn and run.

\[5\] As long as the Spartan king Cleombrotus of Sparta was alive and was accompanied by many fellow soldiers who were ready to die in his defense, which way the scales of victory inclined was unclear. But though the latter shrank from no danger, he proved unable to make headway against his opponents, and fighting heroically he sustained many wounds and died. Subsequently a mass of men rushed in to the spot where he fell, and a great pile of corpses were heaped up.

\[1\] With command of the left wing lost, the heavy column led by Epaminondas bore down on the Spartans. At first their sheer force caused the enemy line to buckle, until the Spartans, fighting bravely over the king’s body, gained possession of it; but they were unable to fight through to victory.

\[2\] The corps of elite fighters, spurred on by the bravery and encouragement of Epaminondas, outdid the Spartans in fighting, with great effort forcing them back. First the Spartans began to give ground, though they held their formation; but eventually many were killed, and, lacking a commander to rally them, the army turned and were completely routed.

\[3\] Epaminondas’s corps pursued those fleeing, cutting down in large numbers any who resisted, and gained for themselves a most glorious victory. For since they had engaged the strongest of the Greeks and, though fielding a smaller force, had miraculously overcome many times their number, they won a great reputation for their heroism. The highest praises were accorded to the general Epaminondas, who chiefly by his own valor and by his brilliant strategy had defeated in battle the hitherto invincible leaders of Hellas.

\[4\] More than four thousand Spartans fell in the battle, and only about three hundred Boeotians. Following the battle, they called a truce to allow for the bodies of the dead to be collected and the Spartans to return to the Peloponnese.

Such was the outcome of the Battle of Leuctra.

# The Benefits of Competition

The ancient Greeks famously valued competition, and the competitive nature of Greek society has been highlighted by historians. The Greeks competed for athletic prizes, military glory, and artistic rewards. In ancient Athens, annual dramatic festivals, such as those held in honor of the god Dionysus, were the locus of intense competition between rival playwrights for coveted prizes. In *Politics* book 2 \(see the selection printed in the final chapter of this book\), Aristotle even tells of a proposal by Hippodamus to institute a formal contest to discover new legal or constitutional measures.

Necessity, it is said, is the “mother of invention”; so perhaps competition could be called the father. This chapter considers two ancient Greek accounts of competitive innovation, the first concerning the development of naturalistic painting in Athens, the second relating the earliest creation of artillery weapons in ancient Syracuse.

## A Painting Contest

The fostering of innovation via the dynamic of competition is exemplified by a story of artistic rivalry in ancient Athens. Zeuxis, the most celebrated painter in antiquity, was born in the Greek city of Heraclea on the Gulf of Taranto, Italy, and settled in Athens in the mid-fifth century BCE. He impressed wealthy patrons by his unprecedented skill in the use of pigments and shading. They were astonished that he could make painted objects look vividly realistic on the flat wooden boards, leather canvasses, and stone walls to which he applied the paint.

The Roman writer Pliny the Elder tells how one day Zeuxis announced that he had produced a still-life painting that surpassed all previous attempts at realistic representation: the image of a bunch of grapes rendered with such naturalism that they had been mistaken for the real thing. Within a few minutes of his unveiling the painting, a flock of birds had flown down and tried to eat the grapes. They had pecked vainly at the painted wooden surface and flown away in bewilderment. Zeuxis was delighted to claim that his skill had fooled the birds, and his proficiency became the talk of Athens.

Some weeks later, Zeuxis was invited to visit the studio of a rival, Parrhasius. Parrhasius was also an immigrant to Athens, from the city of Ephesus on the east coast of Ionia \(modern Turkey\), which had a long tradition of artists—even, unusually, female painters such as Timarata, who was famous for her representation of the goddess Artemis. Entering his fellow artist’s studio, Zeuxis was greeted by Parrhasius, who congratulated him on the painterly technique that had made his grapes look so realistic. Parrhasius then pointed to the curtain drawn across the studio, and invited Zeuxis to draw it aside to reveal his own effort. Zeuxis stepped forward and stretched out his arm to take hold of the curtain, but then realized that what he thought was the curtain was, in fact, only the painting of a curtain. He had to acknowledge that he had been soundly defeated in the mock contest: “My painting of grapes deceived the birds,” he said, “but Parrhasius’s painting deceived even me.”

The tiny proportion of surviving paintings and portraits from ancient times show a brilliantly sophisticated use of paints, colors, shading, and perspective that are unequalled in quality until the Renaissance. The use of innovative techniques, utensils, and pigments in this period all contributed to painters’ overriding aim of creating a faithful visual representation. The contest of Zeuxis and Parrhasius, though clearly fashioned into an appealing story, illustrates the Greeks’ recognition of the way competitive interaction stimulates innovative excellence.

## The Invention of Artillery

The connection between competition and innovation was clear to Dionysius I, the king of Syracuse in the early fourth century BCE. Engaged in constant warfare with the powerful state of Carthage in North Africa, he sought to tackle a particular problem faced by ancient armies: how to conquer fortified towns. Thick walls could make cities virtually impregnable, forcing commanders to waste their resources and tire out their troops with long and costly sieges.

Dionysius knew that Near Eastern nations had used weapons and machines that helped their soldiers to break sieges and thus shorten the process of conquering enemy fortifications, and sought a way to marshal the ingenuity of his people to create effective artillery. His solution was to announce a public contest, offering rewards of both cash and prestige for the invention and construction of siege engines. Craftsmen thronged into the center of Syracuse from Sicily and beyond and vied to create some of the most effective siege weapons in the ancient world. Among these were the catapult and the ballista, battlefield machines capable of launching huge projectiles for considerable distances.

At the same time, Diodorus records, Dionysius sought to outdo his royal ancestors by commissioning the construction of massive sailing ships considerably larger than any that his predecessors had built. These were to lead to Dionysius’s successor Hieron’s commissioning of Archimedes to design the *Syracusia*, the most impressive floating vessel constructed in antiquity.

As the contest of the artists and this example illustrate, stimulating competition, whether public or personal, contemporary or transgenerational, was recognized and utilized in Greek antiquity as a mechanism for creating change. Commercial and technical competition remain the key drivers of innovation in the modern world.

 





## The Father of Invention

### *Diodorus,* History *14.41–42*

\[41\] Dionysius rapidly gathered together skilled workmen from the cities under his control and enticed them with high pay from Italy and Greece as well as from Carthaginian territories. His aim was to produce weapons and missiles of all kinds in vast quantities, and ships with four and five hulls, larger than had ever been constructed. He divided the workmen into teams according to their skills, headed by the leading citizens, and offered them large rewards to produce arms. He distributed among them a uniform style of armor, because having drawn mercenaries from many different nations he was keen to have all his soldiers arrayed in standard armor, believing that the sight of such an army would strike fear into enemies and that in battle the soldiers would fight most effectively in the suit of arms to which they had become accustomed.

\[42\] The Syracusans took up Dionysius’s project with enthusiasm, and they competed strenuously to manufacture weapons. All available spaces, from the porticoes and back rooms of temples to gymnasia and the colonnades in the agora, were crowded with workmen. In addition to public spaces, the most opulent private houses were used for the production of huge quantities of armaments. And in fact it was at this period, with the most skilled craftsmen being concentrated in one place, that the catapult was invented in Syracuse. The efforts of the workmen were encouraged by high pay and by the numerous rewards offered to those who were adjudged the best. In addition, Dionysius circulated daily among the workers and chatted amicably to them, rewarding the most hardworking with gifts and inviting them to dine with him. Consequently, the craftsmen applied themselves wholeheartedly to devising outlandish missiles and military machines that might be able to provide great services. Dionysius also initiated the construction of four- and five-hulled ships, the first person to entertain the creation of vessels like this. As the ruler of a city originally settled by Corinthians, and knowing that triremes had first been built in Corinth, he was eager to build ships of yet greater dimensions.

# The Uses and Abuses of Innovation

In his *Politics*, Aristotle turned his focus on to the question of innovation in relation to the self-governing city-state \(polis\), which for the Greeks was the central institution of civilized existence. Writing in the 340s BCE, Aristotle considers various constitutions, starting with a critique of Socrates’s novel, quasi-communistic design for an ideal state as set out in Plato’s *Republic*, before moving on to the more legalistic blueprint offered in Plato’s *Laws*. Although Aristotle takes a somewhat scattergun approach to Plato’s carefully worked-out theoretical proposals, his recognition that no innovative constitution can succeed that does not accord to human desire for property ownership is psychologically astute and has stood the test of time.

Aristotle proceeds to outline and criticize the theoretical systems presented by two less well known thinkers, Phaleas of Chalcedon and the flamboyant town planner Hippodamus of Miletus. The former’s system presents a striking anticipation of modern communistic ideals. The latter is notable for the proposal, among others, that successful innovations in the political sphere should be rewarded—a recognition of the power of incentivization for creating the new.

After discussing these proposals, Aristotle examines some political organizations that existed in his day \(these are omitted from this selection\). He ends with some brief comments noting that innovation in arts or technical disciplines, where it is generally sought and valued, is in a different category from political innovation, where a principle of conservatism tends to dominate. He leaves open the question of whether creating change is itself always something to be desired.

The distinction Aristotle makes between change in different domains is a valuable reminder that the meanings and processes of innovation may differ widely, depending on the area or discipline to which it relates, and that innovation need not always be desirable.

One further important mechanism for creating change is demonstrated in action by Aristotle’s own extended examinations of thinkers and constitutions: that is, that criticism of the old can itself be useful for laying the groundwork for new ideas. Aristotle’s discussion in book 2 of the *Politics*, though naturally of its time, remains a fundamental classical text for how the question of creating change in the political arena might be addressed.

 





## Aristotle on Constitutions

### Politics *Book 2, 1260b27–1269a29 \(Abridged\)*

#### EXAMINATION OF EXISTING SCENARIOS

\[A\] Since I have decided to consider what form of government might work best for those who are in a position to realize their ideal way of life, I will examine forms of government other than our own, for example states that are reputed to be well-governed, as well as well-respected political theories. My aim is partly to find out what makes sense and works, and the object of innovating on these constitutions is not simply to display ingenuity but because all existing forms of government are unsatisfactory.

\[B\] One must begin with the natural starting point of such an inquiry. Citizens in a state will share either everything in common, or nothing, or some things and not others. To have no share in anything is obviously impossible, as the state is an association and must have a shared location. A single city has a single territory, and its citizens share that one territory. But is it better in a state for all citizens to share everything capable of being shared, or only some things and not others? Citizens could conceivably hold wives, children, and property in common, as Socrates proposes in Plato’s *Republic*. Is this better than our current arrangement?

### *Should a State Be a Unity?*

\[C\] It’s clear that the more a state approaches unity, the less it qualifies as being a state. The nature of a state is to be a plurality, and in tending toward unity a state becomes more like a household, and from being a household becomes more like an individual. \(We would agree that the household is more unified than a state, and an individual more than a household.\) So we shouldn’t aim for this even if we could achieve it, for it would mean the state would no longer be a state.

\[D\] A state is not made up only of many people, but of a variety of kinds of people; a state cannot simply be constituted of similar individuals. It’s not like an alliance, whose usefulness depends simply on the numbers, not on different kinds, of men. The objective of an alliance is military support, where the greater the quantity, the greater the weight.

### *The Principle of Rotation*

\[E\] The principle of reciprocal duties, as I noted in the *Ethics*, is what keeps states in being, so that even when men are free and equal this principle should be maintained. Since they cannot all govern at the same time, they must rotate at year-end or some other period, or according to some order of succession. This way everyone gets to govern, just as if shoemakers and carpenters were to change places instead of keeping on with the same kind of work.

\[F\] This principle should operate in politics too. Clearly it would be better if possible to ensure continuity of government, but if that is not possible it’s right for citizens who are by nature of equal status to take turns in governing, whether to govern is desirable or a burden. So people of equal status should be rotated in public office and be treated equally when out of office. This way one party governs and is governed in turn, as if they were different people in each case. Those who hold office are similarly differentiated by holding now one office and now another.

\[G\] It’s clear from this that a state is not by nature a unity in the way some suppose, and this alleged goal would in fact bring about a state’s dissolution, whereas what is good for anything is what helps preserve it. And there is another argument against seeking to make a state excessively homogeneous: a household is more self-sufficient than an individual, and a state more than a household, and a state emerges only once there’s a community of sufficient size to be self-sufficient. Since the more self-sufficient it is the better, so also the lesser degree of homogeneity the better.

### *Criticism of Communistic Property Arrangements*

\[H\] Next, we should think about property arrangements: should the citizens of the ideal state share possessions in common or not? This question may be discussed separately from legislation about wives and children. While the latter might still belong to individuals, as is the universal practice, one might propose that either property or its use should be communal. That is, plots of land could be individually owned but their produce pooled for common consumption, as in some foreign nations; or conversely, land could be communally owned and farmed but the produce distributed for individual use \(this form of communal ownership is said to exist among some non-Greek peoples\); or both land and produce could be shared.

\[I\] Another system, and one that works more easily, would be one in which those who work land do not own it, because when people work on private land for their own benefit the question of ownership causes ill feeling. If the work done is unequal to the benefit obtained, those who work harder for less gain will resent those who do less work and receive more. In any human situation, living together and sharing is hard enough, but especially so in this kind of scenario. People who club together for travel are a good example of this: they usually fall out over trifles and quarrel about trivial things. So with our household servants, those we get most annoyed with are the ones we employ for routine tasks.

\[J\] These are only some of the disadvantages of common ownership of property. The way we do things now, if it could be enhanced by habitual rules and sound institutions, would work far better, and would have the advantages of both systems. What I mean is that possessions should be held in common up to a point, but the general principle should be private ownership. When everyone has a stake people resent each other less, and people work harder when they busy themselves with their own property. It’s a matter of noblesse oblige to “share and share alike,” as they say. You find this practice in some states, proving that it can work; and it’s especially evident in flourishing states, where it is already found and could be more widely extended. On this scenario everyone has their own possessions, but some part they make available to friends and some part they share the use of with others.

### *Criticism of Plato’s* Laws

\[K\] Most of Plato’s *Laws* consists of proposed “laws,” and not much is said about the constitution as such. Plato wanted to make it more like actual states, but he gradually brings it back round to the ideal state of the *Republic*. Apart from not advocating the sharing of wives and property, he proposes everything else on the same pattern: the same kind of education, the same freedom from essential tasks, the same arrangements for common meals. The only difference is that in the *Laws* common meals are extended to women, and those who bear arms number five thousand as opposed to one thousand in the *Republic*.

\[L\] The Socratic dialogues exhibit extraordinary ingenuity, originality, and inventiveness; but it’s hard to get everything right. We shouldn’t overlook the fact that the number of five thousand citizens just mentioned would require a territory as large as Babylon or some other huge country to support such a number of individuals not working on the land, together with women and servants who would multiply that number many times over. We can create any imaginary blueprint we like, but it should be within the limits of what is possible.

### ***Combining Constitutional Forms*

\[M\] Plato’s system of government aims to be neither a democracy nor an oligarchy, but something in between, which is usually called “a republic,” and is based on the citizenry of soldiers. If he intends to frame a constitution that would suit most states, perhaps this is on the right lines, but not if this constitution is intended to be a second-best to his ideal constitution. In that case one would prefer the Spartan model, or some other constitution based on the rule of the best citizens.

\[N\] Some would indeed say that the best constitution is a combination of all existing forms, and admire the Spartan model as being a mixture of oligarchy, monarchy, and democracy \(the king is the monarch, the council of elders are the oligarchy, and the democratic element is represented by the ephors, since they are selected from the people\). Others, however, say the ephorate is a tyranny and identify the democratic element in the common meals and in aspects of daily life. In the *Laws* it is maintained that the best republic should consist of democracy and tyranny, but these either are not “republics” at all or are the worst kind.

### *Other Proposed Constitutions: Phaleas’s Proposal*

\[A\] Other constitutions have been proposed, some by private individuals, others by philosophers and politicians, which are all more similar to established or existing constitutions than either of Plato’s is. No one else has introduced such novelties as sharing wives and children, or instituting common meals for women, but they start off with the essentials. Some think the regulation of property is the most important thing, noting that revolutions always turn on this.

\[B\] This was recognized by Phaleas of Chalcedon, who was the first to propose that the citizens of a state should have equal wealth. He thought that in a new city-settlement this could be done without difficulty, but would be harder in an established state, and that then the quickest way of equalizing wealth would be for the rich to give but not receive dowries, and vice versa for the poor. Plato in the *Laws* thought that accumulation of wealth should be allowed up to a point, but that \(as I have already observed\) no citizen should possess more than five times that of the least well-off.

\[C\] Those who make such laws should remember what people tend to forget, that in fixing the level of property they must also regulate the number of children. If the number of children is too high for the property to sustain, the law must be revoked; and besides the revocation of the law, the problem arises that many who were rich will become poor, and such people are bound to want to incite revolution.

\[D\] The impact on society of equalizing property was well understood even by some of the ancient legislators. Solon and others passed laws prohibiting an individual from possessing unlimited property, and laws in some states nowadays forbid the sale of property. In Locri, for example, the law forbids people selling their property unless they can demonstrate that they have suffered conspicuous adversity.

### *Criticism of Phaleas’s Proposal*

\[E\] Civil strife arises not only out of inequality of possessions but out of inequality of distinctions, though for opposite reasons. Ordinary people resent the inequality of property, but the elite classes resent distinctions being shared out equally, since then, as the verse runs, “good and bad are held in like esteem.” There are crimes for which the motive is want; and Phaleas supposes that equalization of property will take away the temptation to steal because one is cold or hungry. But want is not the sole motive; people also wish to enjoy themselves and satisfy their desires and find in crime a way to remedy a desire for something beyond mere necessities. There may yet be other motives: even people who feel no such desire may seek pleasure unaccompanied with pain and commit crimes with that in view.

\[F\] What is the remedy for this? In the first case, moderate possessions and employment; in the second, self-control. As for the third, if someone wants to find a pleasure that depends on themselves alone, philosophy is the answer; for other pleasures depend on other people. The fact is that major crimes are caused by a desire for excesses and not necessities. Men do not become dictators to prevent themselves being cold; and that is why to kill a tyrant is more admirable than to kill a thief. So Phaleas’s system works only in preventing lesser crimes.

\[G\] While equalization of property is one thing that safeguards against civil strife, it creates no particular advantage. First, the elite classes will be unhappy because they think they should receive more than an equal share of honors, and this often leads to agitation and revolution. Secondly, human beings are insatiable; first they get used to a two-obol dole, then they want more and more, without end. It’s the nature of desire not to be satisfied, and most people live only to gratify it. In such circumstances, a better point of departure than equality of possession would be to ensure that sensible people should be trained not to want to acquire excess, and those less favored should be prevented from doing so \(that is, they should be kept under control, not treated unfairly\).

\[H\] Βesides, the equalization proposed by Phaleas is flawed. He applies it only to possession of land, whereas wealth may be had in slaves, and cattle, and money, and in a profusion of what are called movable assets. Either all these things must be equalized, or some limit must be imposed on them, or the plan should be dropped altogether.

### *Hippodamus’s Proposal*

\[I\] Hippodamus son of Euryphon, of Miletus, the man who invented urban design and laid out the street plan of the Piraeus, was a strange man, keen to stand out from others, an ambition that led him to eccentricity that some found excessive; he had long hair and wore expensive ornaments, but his clothes were cheap and warm in winter and summer alike. As well as aiming to be an expert on a whole range of natural science, he was the first man without political authority to attempt to propose an ideal form of government.

\[J\] Hippodamus’s state consisted of ten thousand citizens divided into three, one part skilled workers, another farmers, and a third of men in arms. He also divided the land into three parts, sacred, public, and private: the first to be set apart to maintain the worship of the gods, the second to support the soldiers, the third the property of the farmers.

\[K\] He also divided laws into three classes only, corresponding to the three grounds for lawsuits: insult, injury, and homicide. He likewise instituted a single supreme court, to which all cases felt to have been improperly decided might be referred. This court he formed of selected older citizens. Verdicts of the courts were not to be decided by a simple vote, but everyone was to have a tablet on which for a simple verdict of condemnation they could propose a penalty, or for straight acquittal leave the tablet blank; but, if for part acquittal and part condemnation, they could give details. His objection to existing legislation is that it puts jurors in a position of being false to their oaths by forcing them to give a verdict one way or other.

\[L\] He also proposed that those who discover anything for the good of the state should be rewarded, and that the children of those who die in battle should be maintained at public expense \(he imagined that such a law does not exist, whereas it already exists both in Athens and elsewhere\). Officials were to be elected by the people, that is, by the three sections of the state mentioned, and those elected were to supervise the interests of the public, of foreigners, and of orphans.

### ***Criticism of Hippodamus’s Proposal*

\[M\] These are the most striking points in Hippodamus’s constitution. First, one can criticize the division of the citizens into three. If skilled craftsmen, farmers, and soldiers all have a share in ruling but the farmers have no arms and the craftsmen neither arms nor land, this makes the latter effectively the slaves of those who bear arms. So the sharing of honors becomes impossible, since the generals, the guardians of the citizens, and nearly all the principal magistrates must be chosen from those who bear arms. And if the two other classes have no share in ruling, how can they be inclined to respect the constitution? But, you may say, those who have arms should dominate the other sections. That is not easy unless they make up the majority. But if that were the case, why should the other classes share in rule at all and have power to appoint officials?

\[N\] Secondly, what use are farmers to the state? Skilled workers there must be, for they are needed in every state, and they can support themselves by their skills as they do in other cities. If the farmers were really there to maintain the soldiers, it would be fair to have a share in ruling, but on this scheme their land is private, and they cultivate it for their own benefit.

\[O\] Thirdly, as to the communal land out of which the soldiers are maintained, if they are themselves the cultivators there will be no such distinction as the legislator intends between farmers and fighters. If there are to be cultivators distinct both from the farmers on their private land and from the soldiers, that will constitute a fourth class that with share in anything, and so extraneous to the state. And then, if the same people cultivate both their own and communal land, they will be unable to supply a sufficient quantity of produce to maintain two households, so why not maintain themselves and the soldiers from the same land and estates? There is a lot of confusion in all this.

\[P\] The proposal to reward those who discover something useful to the state sounds well and good, but it is hazardous because it’s likely to encourage rivalry and agitation. This raises another, wider, question: it’s not clear whether or not changing a country’s law, even if a better one can be found, is a good thing at all. If change is a bad thing, we can hardly assent to Hippodamus’s proposal, since someone could introduce a measure on the grounds that that it was for the good of all, but which in fact was deleterious to the laws or to the constitution.

### ***Distinctions between Domains of Innovation*

\[A\] Now that we have touched on this subject, it’s worth going into a little more detail. As I have said, opinions differ, and a case may be made in favor of change. In other arts and sciences it has certainly been beneficial; medicine, physical training, and every other art and discipline has innovated on traditional practice. Since politics is a discipline, something similar should apply in this field too. An indication could be provided from the fact that the old laws are very simple and primitive. Greeks used to go about armed, and to buy their brides from each other; and the traces of ancient laws that have survived seem ridiculous, such as the law about homicide at Cumae, whereby if the accuser can produce a certain number of witnesses from his own kinsmen the accused is held guilty of murder.

\[B\] In general what is aimed at is the good, not merely the traditional. But primitive men, whether they were born from the earth or were the survivors of some catastrophe, may be supposed to be no better than ordinary, not very intelligent people today \(lack of intelligence was said to be a mark of the earth-born men\), so it would be ridiculous to cling to their ideas; and even written laws should not be considered unalterable. As in other disciplines, so in politics, it is impossible for every detail to be precisely set down in writing; the general principle has to be stated in writing, but the action taken depends on the particular case.

\[C\] From these considerations it is clear that some occasions and some laws call for change. But from another point of view, great caution should be thought required. If the advantage of a change is minimal, it is dangerous to become accustomed to casually abrogating the law; it would be better to accept some errors on the part of lawmakers and rulers. People will gain less by making the change than they will lose by becoming accustomed to violating authority.

\[D\] The analogy with the arts and sciences is mistaken: alteration in a law is a very different thing from alteration in an art. The law has no power to secure obedience other than the power of habit, which needs time to take effect, so that a readiness to change from old to new laws weakens the power of the law. And even if we accept that the laws should be changed, should they all be changed in every type of state? And are they to be changed by anybody who likes, or only by certain persons? That makes a big difference. Let us now leave this discussion; there will be other occasions to resume it.

\[M\] τὰ μὲν οὖν πλεῖστα καὶ τὰ μάλιστα ἀξιόλογα τῆς Ἱπποδάμου τάξεως ταῦτ᾿ ἐστίν. ἀπορήσειε δ᾿ ἄν τις πρῶτον μὲν τὴν διαίρεσιν τοῦ πλήθους τῶν πολιτῶν. οἵ τε γὰρ τεχνῖται καὶ οἱ γεωργοὶ καὶ οἱ τὰ ὅπλα ἔχοντες κοινωνοῦσι τῆς πολιτείας πάντες, οἱ μὲν γεωργοὶ οὐκ ἔχοντες ὅπλα, οἱ δὲ τεχνῖται οὔτε γῆν οὔτε ὅπλα, ὥστε γίνονται σχεδὸν δοῦλοι τῶν τὰ ὅπλα κεκτημένων. μετέχειν μὲν οὖν πασῶν τῶν τιμῶν ἀδύνατον \(ἀνάγκη γὰρ ἐκ τῶν τὰ ὅπλα ἐχόντων καθίστασθαι καὶ στρατηγοὺς καὶ πολιτοφύλακας καὶ τὰς κυριωτάτας ἀρχὰς ὡς εἰπεῖν\]· μὴ μετέχοντας δὲ τῆς πολιτείας πῶς οἷόν τε φιλικῶς ἔχειν τὴν πολιτείαν; ἀλλὰ δεῖ κρείττους εἶναι τοὺς6 τὰ ὅπλα γε κεκτημένους ἀμφοτέρων τῶν μερῶν. τοῦτο δ᾿ οὐ ῥᾴδιον μὴ πολλοὺς ὄντας, εἰ δὲ τοῦτ᾿ ἔσται, τί δεῖ τοὺς ἄλλους μετέχειν τῆς πολιτείας καὶ κυρίους εἶναι τῆς τῶν ἀρχόντων καταστάσεως;

\[O\] ἔτι δὲ τὴν κοινήν, ἀφ᾿ ἧς οἱ προπολεμοῦντες ἕξουσι τὴν τροφήν, εἰ μὲν αὐτοὶ γεωργήσουσιν, οὐκ ἂν εἴη τὸ μάχιμον ἕτερον καὶ τὸ γεωργοῦν, βούλεται δ᾿ ὁ νομοθέτης· εἰ δ᾿ ἕτεροί τινες ἔσονται τῶν τε τὰ ἴδια γεωργούντων καὶ τῶν μαχίμων, τέταρτον αὖ μόριον ἔσται τοῦτο τῆς πόλεως, οὐδενὸς μετέχον ἀλλ᾿ ἀλλότριον τῆς πολιτείας. ἀλλὰ μὴν εἴ τις τοὺς αὐτοὺς θήσει τούς τε τὴν ἰδίαν καὶ τοὺς τὴν κοινὴν γεωργοῦντας, τό τε πλῆθος ἄπορον ἔσται τῶν καρπῶν ἐξ ὧν ἕκαστος γεωργήσει δύο οἰκίαις, καὶ τίνος ἕνεκεν οὐκ εὐθὺς ἀπὸ τῆς γῆς καὶ τῶν αὐτῶν κλήρων αὑτοῖς τε τὴν τροφὴν λήψονται καὶ τοῖς μαχίμοις παρέξουσιν; ταῦτα δὴ πάντα πολλὴν ἔχει ταραχήν.

\[P\] *1268b22* περὶ δὲ τοῦ τοῖς εὑρίσκουσί τι τῇ πόλει συμφέρον ὡς δεῖ γίνεσθαί τινα τιμήν, οὐκ ἔστιν ἀσφαλὲς τὸ νομοθετεῖν, ἀλλ᾿ εὐόφθαλμον ἀκοῦσαι μόνον· ἔχει γὰρ συκοφαντίας καὶ κινήσεις, ἂν τύχῃ, πολιτείας. ἐμπίπτει δ᾿ εἰς ἄλλο πρόβλημα καὶ σκέψιν ἑτέραν· ἀποροῦσι γάρ τινες πότερον βλαβερὸν ἢ συμφέρον ταῖς πόλεσι τὸ κινεῖν τοὺς πατρίους νόμους ἂν ᾖ τις ἄλλος βελτίων. διόπερ οὐ ῥᾴδιον τῷ λεχθέντι ταχὺ συγχωρεῖν, εἴπερ μὴ συμφέρει κινεῖν· ἐνδέχεται δ᾿ εἰσηγεῖσθαί τινας νόμων λύσιν ἢ πολιτείας ὡς κοινὸν ἀγαθόν.

 

 

\[A\] ἐπεὶ δὲ πεποιήμεθα μνείαν, ἔτι μικρὰ περὶ αὐτοῦ διαστείλασθαι βέλτιον, ἔχει γάρ, ὥσπερ εἴπομεν, ἀπορίαν. καὶ δόξειεν ἂν βέλτιον εἶναι τὸ κινεῖν· ἐπὶ γοῦν τῶν ἄλλων ἐπιστημῶν τοῦτο συνενήνοχεν, οἷον ἰατρικὴ κινηθεῖσα παρὰ τὰ πάτρια καὶ γυμναστικὴ καὶ ὅλως αἱ τέχναι πᾶσαι καὶ αἱ δυνάμεις· ὥστ᾿ ἐπεὶ μίαν τούτων θετέον καὶ τὴν πολιτικήν, δῆλον ὅτι καὶ περὶ ταύτην ἀναγκαῖον ὁμοίως ἔχειν. σημεῖον δ᾿ ἂν γεγονέναι φαίη τις ἐπ᾿ αὐτῶν τῶν ἔργων, τοὺς γὰρ ἀρχαίους νόμους λίαν ἁπλοῦς εἶναι καὶ βαρβαρικούς· ἐσιδηροφοροῦντό τε γὰρ οἱ Ἕλληνες καὶ τὰς γυναῖκας ἐωνοῦντο παρ᾿ ἀλλήλων, ὅσα τε λοιπὰ τῶν ἀρχαίων ἐστί που νομίμων εὐήθη πάμπαν ἐστίν, οἷον ἐν Κύμῃ περὶ τὰ φονικὰ νόμος ἐστίν, ἂν πλῆθός τι παράσχηται μαρτύρων ὁ διώκων τὸν φόνον τῶν αὑτοῦ συγγενῶν, ἔνοχον εἶναι τῷ φόνῳ τὸν φεύγοντα.

\[B\] ζητοῦσι δ᾿ ὅλως οὐ τὸ πάτριον ἀλλὰ τἀγαθὸν πάντες· εἰκός τε τοὺς πρώτους, εἴτε γηγενεῖς ἦσαν εἴτ᾿ ἐκ φθορᾶς τινὸς ἐσώθησαν, ὁμοίους εἶναι καὶ τοὺς τυχόντας καὶ τοὺς ἀνοήτους, ὥσπερ καὶ λέγεται κατὰ τῶν γηγενῶν, ὥστ᾿ ἄτοπον τὸ μένειν ἐν τοῖς τούτων δόγμασιν. πρὸς δὲ τούτοις οὐδὲ τοὺς γεγραμμένους ἐᾶν ἀκινήτους βέλτιον. ὥσπερ γὰρ καὶ περὶ τὰς ἄλλας τέχνας, καὶ τὴν πολιτικὴν τάξιν ἀδύνατον ἀκριβῶς πάντα γραφῆναι· καθόλου γὰρ ἀναγκαῖον γραφῆναι, αἱ δὲ πράξεις περὶ τῶν καθ᾿ ἕκαστόν εἰσιν.

\[C\] ἐκ μὲν οὖν τούτων φανερὸν ὅτι κινητέοι καὶ τινὲς καὶ ποτὲ τῶν νόμων εἰσίν. ἄλλον δὲ τρόπον ἐπισκοποῦσιν εὐλαβείας ἂν δόξειεν εἶναι πολλῆς. ὅταν γὰρ ᾖ τὸ μὲν βέλτιον μικρόν, τὸ δ᾿ ἐθίζειν εὐχερῶς λύειν τοὺς νόμους φαῦλον, φανερὸν ὡς ἐατέον ἐνίας ἁμαρτίας καὶ τῶν νομοθετῶν καὶ τῶν ἀρχόντων· οὐ γὰρ τοσοῦτον ὠφελήσεται κινήσας ὅσον βλαβήσεται τοῖς ἄρχουσιν ἀπειθεῖν ἐθισθείς.

\[D\] ψεῦδος δὲ καὶ τὸ παράδειγμα τὸ περὶ τῶν τεχνῶν· οὐ γὰρ ὅμοιον τὸ κινεῖν τέχνην καὶ νόμον· ὁ γὰρ νόμος ἰσχὺν οὐδεμίαν ἔχει πρὸς τὸ πείθεσθαι πλὴν παρὰ τὸ ἔθος, τοῦτο δ᾿ οὐ γίνεται εἰ μὴ διὰ χρόνου πλῆθος, ὥστε τὸ ῥᾳδίως μεταβάλλειν ἐκ τῶν ὑπαρχόντων νόμων εἰς ἑτέρους νόμους καινοὺς ἀσθενῆ ποιεῖν ἐστὶ τὴν τοῦ νόμου δύναμιν. ἔτι δ᾿ εἰ καὶ κινητέοι, πότερον καὶ πάντες καὶ ἐν πάσῃ πολιτείᾳ, ἢ οὔ; καὶ πότερον τῷ τυχόντι ἢ τισίν; ταῦτα γὰρ ἔχει μεγάλην διαφοράν. διὸ νῦν μὲν ἀφῶμεν ταύτην τὴν σκέψιν· ἄλλων γάρ ἐστι καιρῶν.
