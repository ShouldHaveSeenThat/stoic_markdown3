PREFACE

New editions of speeches from Thucydides’ 

*History of the Peloponnesian War* used to run in high supply, but it has now been de cades since such a volume appeared in En glish. Among the last was the 1973 *Speeches of Thucydides* edited by H.F. Harding, who hardly concealed his conviction that the downfall of Athens had acquired portentous relevance in the era of the Vietnam War. In recent years, Thucydides has nevertheless made a number of fresh appearances on the public stage. Se nior po liti cal offi-cials are once again intimating that they take cues from his work, while Graham Allison’s notion of the “Thucydides trap” has been met with considerable fanfare \(and criticism\). That “trap,” 

according to Allison, a Harvard po liti cal scien-tist, is an international relations princi ple which ix

PREFACE

dictates that war is inevitable when a rising power threatens the priority of a ruling one \(that is, Athens and China in the first instance; Sparta and the U.S. in the second\). In 2017, when his *Destined for War: Can Amer i ca and* *China Escape Thucydides’s Trap? * landed on bookshelves, Allison was invited to the White House to brief the U.S. National Security Council on his— and Thucydides’— ideas. 

It is perhaps little surprise that Thucydides has come to seem timely again in the current po liti cal moment, with its intensified preoccu-pations over misuse of language and alternate versions of truth and history, anx i eties over shifts in the global order, and fears at the prospects of new foreign conflicts. As the stability of democracy and demo cratic institutions is put ever more to the test, now may also be an op-portune time for reevaluating the idealized leg-acy of the classical Athenians— those revered x

PREFACE

forefathers of Western democracy—on the basis of their own words. The Athenian speeches rendered by Thucydides may well be dazzling for their displays of rhe toric, but it is easy to forget that the deliberations held in the framework of Athens’ renowned and radical democracy resulted in policies that led to the loss of innumer-able lives and to the collapse of Athens’ empire after little more than a half century. 

When Rob Tempio approached me about contributing a volume on Thucydides to Princeton University Press’s Ancient Wisdom series, I asked him whether I might do so in an unusual way. I wanted to select speeches from Thucydides that illustrated the “ancient wisdom” of their author— his sophistication of thought, elegance of language, and mastery of drama and pacing. 

Equally, though, I wanted to acknowledge the disastrous courses of action that Athens pursued at the time, despite the city’s renown for xi

PREFACE

the rhetorical and deliberative culture epito-mized in those very speeches. I am im mensely grateful to Rob for being so open to my taking that approach and for offering such helpful guidance along the way. I also wish to thank Edith Foster, Neville Morley, and the two readers for the Press, from whose comments and corrections I benefited greatly, as well as Christopher Ell, who painstakingly reviewed the translations here. Chris has been an enthusiastic and insightful interlocutor about the finer points of Thucydides’ notoriously challenging Greek. 

This book is dedicated to Professor H.D. 

Cameron. Professor Cameron was the first to introduce me to Thucydides and to show me— 

along with thousands of other University of Michigan freshmen over the course of many decades— just why the “ Great Books” are worthy of the name.

INTRODUCTION

On August 11, 1777, John Adams, then a dele-gate to the Second Continental Congress in session in Philadelphia, wrote a letter to his ten- year- old son, John Quincy. In light of the ongoing War of In de pen dence and with a mind to other wars and “Councils and Negotiations” 

that the future might hold for the boy, Adams urged him “to turn your Thoughts early to such Studies, as will afford you the most solid Instruction and Improvement for the Part which may be allotted you to act on the Stage of Life.” 

He gave one recommendation in par tic u lar: 

“ There is no History, perhaps, better adapted to this usefull Purpose than that of Thucidides.” 

For Adams, Thucydides’ *History of the Peloponnesian War* contained within it insight of every pos si ble “usefull” sort: “You will find it xv

INTRODUCTION

full of Instruction to the Orator, the Statesman, the General, as well as to the Historian and the Phi los o pher.”1

For centuries, Thucydides has been made to wear each of those very hats. Politicians and military personnel, historians, po liti cal scien-tists, and classicists have all laid claim, often in radically dif fer ent ways, to his work and wisdom. Today, the *History* enjoys a status—in university curricula, among po liti cal theorists, and in military and policy communities—as a foundational source for theorizations of democracy, international relations, war, and human and state be hav ior. Thucydides himself might not be disappointed to know this, for toward the beginning of his *History* he announces that he has composed his work with future ages in mind: Perhaps the lack of fantastical material here will seem charmless to my audiences. 

xvi

INTRODUCTION

Nevertheless, I will be content if anyone who desires to gain a clear understanding of past events, and of future events that will one day resemble the past more or less closely— human nature being what it is— 

finds my work useful. This work was composed to be a possession for all time and not as a showpiece to be heard for a fleeting moment. \(1.22\)

Of course, not every one agrees with what Thucydides implies about the universalism of 

“ human nature,” a common translation for his substantive adjective *anthrōpinon* \(which covers the range of human things— thoughts, be hav-iors, affairs, and so on; some translators prefer 

“ 

human condition”\). Nevertheless, ever since Thomas Hobbes published his 1629 translation of the *History*, the first En glish translation prepared from the Greek, Thucydides has continued xvii

INTRODUCTION

to cast a long shadow over Western po liti cal thought. Today, he is even more a staple of the po liti cal science than the history classroom, his *History* as often the subject of dissertations in international relations as in Classics. 

Modern readings of Thucydides often shine the spotlight on the speeches that he attributes to his work’s “characters.” Those passages are especially rich in abstract reflections on war, human be hav ior, and what today we call po li tical theory. It is also undoubtedly “in the speeches that much of the most explicit analy sis of the nature of Athenian imperialism appears.”2 These speeches are, however, difficult to find collected together outside of translations of Thucydides’ 

long, dense, and difficult *History* in its entirety. 

This volume seeks to make the speeches more accessible by presenting them together, in a new translation that is faithful to the Greek but which also aims to be fresh and approachable. 

xviii

INTRODUCTION

Here readers will find all of the speeches delivered before the Athenian Assembly \(“On Justifying a War: Pericles’ First War Speech”; “On Holding the Course: Pericles’ Last Speech”; 

“On Realpolitik: The Mytilenean Debate”; and 

“On Launching a Foreign Invasion: The Sicilian Debate”\), as well as the two best- known passages of the *History* as a whole: Pericles’ funeral oration \(“On Dying for Your Country: Pericles’ 

Funeral Oration”\) and the Melian Dialogue \(“On Ruthlessness: The Melian Dialogue”\). 

The remainder of this introduction provides an orientation to the speeches, their author, his work, and his times; the last section will briefly discuss Thucydides’ “Athenian thesis” and exceptional status in American po liti cal thought. 

This background is, however, simply intended to facilitate— and not to direct— analy sis, appre-ciation, and critique of the speeches and the ideas that they develop. 

xix

INTRODUCTION

The Rise of the Athenian Empire Each of the speeches in this volume contains remarks upon the origins, validity, and character of the Athenian Empire, the very thing that the Athenians gambled when they voted to enter into war with Sparta. Any potted history of the rise of that empire would, however, be misleading, for the ancient sources— Herodotus, Thucydides, Aristotle, and other authors \(including tragic and comic playwrights\), along with inscriptions, buildings, artworks, and other material evidence— tell a rich but incomplete and sometimes contradictory story. Most of the surviving ancient evidence originates with Athens and Athenians, and already in classical antiquity some people were aggravated by the triumphalist “Athenian history of Athens.”3 

Despite the impossibility of tracing a straight-forward or objective picture, it will be useful to xx

INTRODUCTION

approach the speeches with a general outline of Athens’ rise to power in mind. The narrative that follows is based largely on Thucydides’ 

own account in the first book of his *History*, in part because it is a primary source of our evidence, but also because its par tic u lar contours are programmatic for the rest of Thucydides’ 

work. \(References are to passages from the *History* unless other wise indicated.\) Stirrings of Athens’ expansionist ambitions can be detected just after the reforms of Cleisthenes in ca. 508, which established the basic structures and institutions of Athenian democracy. After a military victory on the nearby island of Euboea in 506, the Athenians sent settlers there to establish the city’s first cleruchy—a kind of colony whose settlers owned the land but retained their Athenian citizenship—in the town of Chalcis. At the time, Athens was still po liti cally insignificant; xxi

INTRODUCTION

in his *Histories* \(late 5th century bce\), Herodotus recounts that when, in the first years of the fifth century, Athenian forces came to aid the coastal Ionian cities rebelling from Persian rule \(the Athenians ethnically identified as Ionians\), the Persian king Darius had to ask just who they were \(Hdt. 5.150\). Regardless of its historicity, the anecdote suggests that Athens’ 

subsequent rise was perceived as rapid. 

True Athenian hegemony in the Aegean region seems to have originated in the immediate aftermath of the two failed Persian invasions of Greece; the first dispatched by King Darius, the second led by his son Xerxes. Decisive Greek victories in the summer of 479 at the battles of Plataea \(in the Greek mainland region of Boeo-tia\) and Mycale \(on the west coast of Asia Minor, opposite the island of Samos\) effectively ended the second Persian invasion of xxii

INTRODUCTION

Greece, secured the liberation of the Greek Ionian cities, and turned the tide of war in the Greek co ali tion’s favor. That co ali tion, the Hellenic Alliance, had been forged at a sum-mit in Corinth three years earlier, just before Xerxes launched his attack on Greece. 

Following the victory at Mycale, the Spartans returned home while the Athenians and other alliance members continued to engage the Persians. In Athens, work also began on rebuilding the city, which Xerxes and his forces had destroyed shortly after their victory in the 480 Battle of Thermopylae. Despite the Spartans’ protestations, the Athenians rapidly reconstructed and expanded their city walls and finished fortifying the port of Piraeus. 

Thucydides ascribes these initiatives to the general Themistocles, the architect of the Greek victory at Salamis, who “helped to begin xxiii

INTRODUCTION

establishing the empire” by encouraging his compatriots to continue investing in their new-found naval supremacy \(1.93\). 

In 478, the Spartans sent the general Pausanias, who had led the Greeks to victory at Plataea, to command the still- united Greek forces in attacks on Cyprus and Byzantium, a city on the site of modern- day Istanbul. Pausanias came under suspicion of Persian sympathies and, according to Thucydides, lost favor with the Ionian Greeks “ because he was violent.” 

Just when the allies had asked Athens to assume leadership, Pausanias was recalled to Sparta to be investigated “for acting more like a tyrant than a general.” The Spartans dispatched another commander to replace him, but when he arrived he found that the Athenians had already taken charge. Thucydides explains that, at that point, the Spartans were content simply to return home, as they desired “to be done with the xxiv

INTRODUCTION

war against Persia and thought that the Athenians were perfectly fit to take charge and were at that moment on good terms with them” \(1.95\). 

According to Thucydides, the Athenians were thus “invested with hegemony by the free will of the allies.” This was the birth of what is now commonly known as the Delian League, a modern term for what was initially a confeder-ation led by Athens. In administering the alliance, the Athenians instituted the office of the ten “Trea sur ers of Hellas,” who were to collect tribute from the allies to fund the league’s char-ter purpose of “avenging what they had suffered by laying waste to the lands of the King” 

of Persia \(1.96\). These monies were, at first, kept on the island of Delos, an Ionian sanctuary dedicated to the god Apollo, where the league’s meetings were held. Certain island powers \(Chios, Lesbos, and Samos\) contributed ships in lieu of monetary tribute. 

xxv

INTRODUCTION

Within a de cade or so, the alliance counted some two hundred members; that number would eventually increase by half. Under the leadership of Cimon, an Athenian general and statesman, the league became increasingly aggressive in pursuing its founding aim of attacking the Persians. Supported by their allies, the Athenians gained full command of the Aegean Sea. Yet as Athenian power consolidated, resentment brewed among other members of the league. The allies might have entered of their own free will into a co ali tion with Athens but leaving was now another matter. When the islands of Naxos and Thasos attempted to break free in the 460s, Athens violently suppressed the revolts— and set a pre ce dent for the approach that it would take toward its “allies” over the following de cades \(1.98–101\). 

Athenian expansionism provoked the resentment of Sparta, and Thucydides rec ords that a xxvi

INTRODUCTION

Spartan plan to invade Attica was foiled only by a major earthquake in 464 \(1.101\). That earthquake in turn sparked a revolt of Sparta’s serf population, the Helots, and when Sparta snubbed Athenian offers of assistance in putting down the revolt, tensions began to come to a head. By 460, Athens and its allies had entered into war with Sparta and the Peloponnesian League, an alliance that dated to the previous century. During the campaigns of this, the First Peloponnesian War \(460–446\), the Athenians continued to maneuver against Persia in distant theaters, particularly Egypt, where they had been asked to aid the Egyptians in a revolt from the Persian Empire. The Persians, however, managed to quell that revolt and destroy most of the Athenian fleet. 

Hostilities between Athens and Sparta continued despite a five years’ truce sworn in 451. 

Fi nally, in 446, Athens agreed to cede a number xxvii

INTRODUCTION

of territories back to Sparta, and the two sides agreed to the Thirty Years’ Peace. Athens continued, however, to come into conflict with its own allies, and in 440 a faction from the island of Samos attempted a revolt from the Athenian alliance. Byzantium followed suit. The Samian rebellion was crushed after the Athenians conducted a siege of nine months and both Samos and Byzantium returned as subject states to what by now was the Athenian Empire, in Greek the *arkhē*. 

In ca. 454 the Athenians transferred the Delian League’s trea sury from Delos to Athens, and from then on one- sixtieth of each state’s tribute payment was dedicated to the goddess Athena. Those amounts were inscribed and publicly displayed on steles, large stone tablets that are known as the “Athenian Tribute Lists,” 

of which significant fragments have been found. 

Tribute came to be collected annually in the xxviii

INTRODUCTION

days before the City Dionysia, Athens’ largest festival and the occasion that saw the premiere of most surviving ancient Greek plays. The allies were also compelled to send offerings of the 

“first fruits” of their harvests to the Athenian festival of the Great Panathenaea, the city’s cele bration of its patron goddess. 

In the *History*, both Pericles and Cleon refer explic itly \(in “On Holding the Course: Pericles’ 

Last Speech” and “On Realpolitik: The Mytilenean Debate”\) to the Athenian empire as a 

“tyranny,” a conceit that was also sometimes fancifully dramatized on the Athenian comic stage \(in, for example, Aristophanes’ play *Knights* and Eupolis’ lost comedy *Demes*\). Athens attempted to maintain control over its subject states in a number of ways. It eventually demanded that all major trials be held in Athens itself, where in 461 the court system had been revolutionized and expanded by the Reforms of xxix

INTRODUCTION

Ephialtes. At some point between the 440s and 420s \(scholarly opinion is divided\), the city also passed the Coinage Decree, which outlawed the use throughout the empire of any silver coinage but the Athenian tetradrachm \(the decree’s efficacy is, however, a matter of doubt\). 

Cleruchies continued to be established on conquered territory well into the era of the Peloponnesian War. 

The empire also served as a conduit of Athenian culture. The Athenians regularly imposed demo cratic regimes on their allied states, which, also under varying degrees of compulsion, adopted certain Athenian religious and cultural practices. One testament to Athens’ “soft power” 

in this period was the rapid spread across the wider Mediterranean, even beyond the imperial territories, of enthusiasm for the Athenian theater. The sheer size and complexity of the empire— and of Athenian approaches to xxx

INTRODUCTION

managing it— made for an enormous bureaucracy, much of which was administered by highly skilled “public” slaves.4

The figure that dominated the middle decades of the fifth century in Athens was Pericles, an aristocrat, politician, and im mensely successful general. Thucydides’ esteem for Pericles’ talents as a politician is on display in his 

“Obituary” for him in Book 2 of the *History* \(see the introduction to “On Holding the Course: Pericles’ Last Speech”\), where he observes that, under Pericles’ leadership, the city became “a democracy in name, but a rule by the first man in real ity” \(2.65\). There Thucydides also attributes Athens’ ultimate loss in the war to the mistakes of Pericles’ successors, who devoted their efforts not to the city’s best interests but to their own populistic jostling. Texts from subsequent de cades, especially Socratic dialogues by Plato, are more overtly critical in xxxi

INTRODUCTION

their appraisals of Pericles, but unan i mous in acknowledging his skills as a public speaker. 

Pericles is credited with launching the city’s massive building program of the 440s and 430s, about which Thucydides is notoriously silent. 

It often has been assumed that Delian League monies were appropriated for the program, though that view has lately been questioned; regardless of the actual funding source, these lavish structures— the Parthenon among them— 

served to proclaim Athens’ status as an imperial city.5 Sparta, on the other hand, remained an unwalled assemblage of villages throughout the fifth century. Early in his *History*, Thucydides reflects that, if Sparta were to dis-appear, later generations would forget just how mighty it had been. “But if this were to happen to Athens,” he continues, “the sheer sight of \[the ruins\] would leave the impression that the city’s power had been twice what it actually is” \(1.10\). 

xxxii

INTRODUCTION

Yet what Sparta lacked in its cityscape was outweighed by the stability and soundness of its institutional foundations; by Thucydides’ time, it had been operating under the same constitution for more than four centuries \(1.18\). In the *History*, Spartan moderation, adherence to tradition, and contentment with quiet peace are made to stand in sharp relief against Thucydides’ 

portrait of Athenian rashness, innovation, and restlessness. 

The Peloponnesian War

Thucydides submits that the “truest” but least publicly acknowledged cause for the outbreak of the Peloponnesian War in 431 was “that Athens had become mighty, which provoked fear in Sparta” \(1.23\). He therefore identifies Spartan worry over Athens’ consolidated power as the 

“ultimate” cause of the war, but he also discusses a number of “proximate” causes. 

xxxiii

INTRODUCTION

The first was a conflict that flared up in 435. 

That year, a demo cratic revolution provoked the aristocrats of Epidamnus \(west of modern day Tirana, Albania\) to seek help from their “ mother city,” the island of Corcyra. When that request fell on deaf ears, the Epidamnians turned to Corinth, Corcyra’s own mother city. The Cor-inthians, the Peloponnesian League allies of Sparta, claimed that they had obligations toward the Epidamnians and resented Corcyra’s evident contempt. When Corinth dispatched a force to Epidamnus, the Corcyraeans petitioned for help from Athens, which agreed to join them in a defensive alliance. The culmination of the 

“Corcyraean Affair” \(1.24–55\) was a naval battle between Corinth and Corcyra. The Corinthi-ans won an initial victory but backed down after thirty Athenian ships came to Corcyra’s defense. 

xxxiv

INTRODUCTION

Not long afterward, the Athenians began a siege of Potidaea, a town on the Pallene peninsula \(the first “leg” of Chalcidice\) in north-eastern Greece. Potidaea was a subject ally of Athens but retained ties with Corinth, which was also its own mother city. At the urgings of the Peloponnesian League, Potidaea revolted from the Delian League in 433/2; Athens responded by besieging the city. Relations between Athens and the Peloponnesian League thus continued to break down and, at the Cor-inthians’ insistence, the next year Sparta voted to make a formal declaration that Athens had broken the treaty \(1.87\). The Spartans then threatened Athens with war if it failed to comply with a series of demands: that it end the siege of Potidaea, allow the island of Aegina its in de pen dence, and lift economic sanctions that it had decreed against Megara, a Peloponnesian xxxv

INTRODUCTION

ally to Athens’ northwest. When the Athenians refused to comply with any of these demands, Spartan emissaries issued a final ultimatum: 

“The Spartans want peace to continue, if you are willing to allow the Greeks their autonomy” 

\(1.139\). At the Athenian Assembly convened to discuss the city’s next move, Pericles encouraged his compatriots to stand their ground \(see “On Justifying a War: Pericles’ First War Speech”\), and the Athenians voted to go to war. Each side, then, cast the other as aggressor. 

The conflict remembered as the Peloponnesian War broke out halfway into the Thirty Years’ Peace that had been negotiated in 446. It unfolded in at least three discrete phases, yet Thucydides himself casts his *History* as the history of a single war and, with reference to that war as a whole, claims at the start of his work that he began to write “in the belief that it would be a massive one and more noteworthy xxxvi

INTRODUCTION

than those that had come before.” He also notes that, before the war was over, all Greece had been forced to take sides. 

The phases of the war are typically desig-nated as follows:

1. *The Archidamian War*, named for Archidamus II, king and general of Sparta, and known to Thucydides as the Ten Years’ War \(431–421\). This phase ended with an inconclusive Athenian victory and the unsteady 

“Peace of Nicias”; 

2. *The Sicilian Expedition* \(415–413\), which resulted in catastrophe for Athens; 3. *The Decelean War*, so- called for the Peloponnesians’ hostile fortification of Decelea in the region of Attica \(where Athens was located\), and known to Thucydides as the Ionian War \(413–404\). This phase ended with Athens’ definitive surrender. 

xxxvii

INTRODUCTION

Thucydides lived to see the end of the war \(see below, “Thucydides and His *History*”\), but his narrative breaks off in 411 \(subsequent ancient historians of the war tended to begin their accounts where he left off\). He does, however, express his opinion that the beginning of the end of the war was Athens’ misguided invasion of Sicily, the so- called Sicilian Expedition \(see 

“On Launching a Foreign Invasion: The Sicilian Debate”\). Spartan reinforcements sent to aid the Sicilian forces turned the tide of that war in the “Greek west” and secured the Athenians’ 

defeat. Of some 5,000 troops deployed from Athens, “few . . . ever saw their homecoming day” \(7.87\). 

Despite the magnitude of the blow that Athens suffered in Sicily, neither Athens nor Sparta waited long to begin preparations for renewed war against each other. In 412, Sparta forged an alliance with Persia, which turned the tide in xxxviii

INTRODUCTION

the Peloponnesians’ favor. Athens’ allies now saw the city’s substantially weakened position as an opportunity to revolt from Athenian rule. 

The final major battle of the war was fought at the Hellespont in late summer of 405. Under the leadership of their general, Lysander, the Spartans destroyed the Athenian naval fleet at the Battle of Aegospotami. In a famous passage of his *Hellenica*, the Athenian historian Xenophon, Thucydides’ younger con temporary, describes the dread that the news of Aegospotami provoked when it arrived in Athens. 

The Athenians, he recounts, spent that night mourning the dead, but also “lamenting much more for themselves, worried that they would suffer the very things which they had wrought upon the Melians . . . and upon the Histiaeans and the Scionaeans and the Tornaeans and Aeginetans and so many other Greeks” \(Xen. 

*Hell. * 2.2.3\). 

xxxix

INTRODUCTION

With no allies left but Samos, the starving Athenians fi nally surrendered to Lysander in the spring of 404. Sparta’s allies were eager to see Athens suffer the very fate that its people had so feared in the immediate aftermath of Aegospotami. Yet Xenophon describes how it was, unexpectedly, the Spartans who refused to destroy the city on the grounds that they could not “enslave a Greek city that had done so much good when Greece had been caught in the greatest dangers,” a reference to the Persian Wars. The terms that they dictated in the end required that Athens tear down its walls, give up all but twelve ships, allow exiled citizens to return, share friends and enemies with Sparta, and “follow the Spartans on land and sea, wherever they should lead” \(Xen. *Hell. * 2.2.20\). When the Athenian ambassadors communicated these terms to the Athenian Assembly, the people voted to accept. The Peloponnesians allegedly xl

INTRODUCTION

tore down the walls of Athens joyously and to the accompaniment of flutes, “in the belief that the day marked the beginning of freedom for Greece” \(Xen. *Hell. * 2.20.23\). 

Thucydides and His *History* We know little about Thucydides’ own life. He begins his *History* by identifying himself as an Athenian; its first words are “Thucydides the Athenian composed the War of the Peloponnesians and Athenians . . .” \(1.1\). He claims that he was alive for all of that war, and implies that, from its start, he was old enough to understand its events \(5.26\). He tells us that he was serving as elected general in 424, which means that he was likely born in the early 450s. Thucydides thus came of age in the brief but momentous era that saw the Athenian Empire at its height.6

When Thucydides narrates his own role in the war, he refers to himself in the third person xli

INTRODUCTION

as the son of Olorus \(4.104; Olorus was an aristocratic name associated with Thrace, the region to the northeast of Greece\). In Book 2, he mentions that he survived the plague that devastated Athens during the first years of the war \(2.48\). In Book 4, he narrates how, in 424, he led the Athenian forces in an attempt to preserve the Athenians’ hold on Amphipolis, their valuable base in Thrace. He was entrusted with the mission, he explains, because of his stake in the local gold mines and the influence that this granted him in the region. He arrived too late, however, to prevent Athens from losing Amphipolis to the Spartans under the command of the extraordinary general Brasidas. 

For that failure, the Athenians cast Thucydides into exile, where he would remain for twenty years. That long exile was precisely what allowed him the peace and quiet needed to work on his *History* and to conduct inter-xlii

INTRODUCTION

views with parties on both sides of the conflict \(5.26\). The *History* shows full knowledge of the outcome of the war, which ended in 404; Thucydides is therefore assumed to have died in about 400. This is the extent of the bio-graphical information that can be inferred from his work; additional details are furnished by later ancient biographers but should be treated with caution.7

Thucydides or ga nized his *History* by campaign season— consecutive winters and summers of the war— and the text’s arrangement in eight books is not his own. The work’s degree of completion is still a matter of debate; some scholars have seen the lack of speeches in Book 5 

\(the Melian Dialogue is not, strictly speaking, a speech\) and Book 8 as the result of the work’s unfinished state.8 In his extensive critical essay *On Thucydides*, the ancient critic Dionysius of Halicarnassus \(1st c. bce\) noted that Cratippus, xliii

INTRODUCTION

Thucydides’ younger con temporary and supposed editor, had commended the lack of “assembly speeches” toward the end of the *History* because he found their earlier prevalence “hindering” and even “annoying” \(§16\). 

Modern readers of the *History* rarely voice that complaint, though they have often wondered to what extent the speeches are Thucydides’ own compositions. Toward the beginning of his work, Thucydides provides this account of his methodology:

As to the speeches that individuals gave both when war was approaching and when it was already underway, it has been difficult to remember precisely what was said, regardless of whether I heard the speeches myself or had them communicated to me by others. That is why I have recorded what I thought that each speaker xliv

INTRODUCTION

ought to have said in light of the demands of the specific moment, though I have kept as close as pos si ble to the complete spirit of what was actually said. \(1.22\) Despite Thucydides’ avowed commitment to keeping “as close as pos si ble to the complete spirit of what was actually said,” Pericles’ first war speech \(“On Justifying a War: Pericles’ 

First War Speech”\), his funeral oration \(“On Dying for Your Country: Pericles’ Funeral Oration”\), and the Melian Dialogue \(“On Ruthlessness: The Melian Dialogue”\) have all proven particularly vulnerable to charges of “in-authenticity.” Whether these passages represent 

“what was actually said” by the speakers \(we will never truly know\), they remain challenging and illuminating for students of Thucydides, the Peloponnesian War, classical Athens, and politi cal philosophy more generally.

INTRODUCTION

The “Athenian Thesis” 

The speeches included in this volume constitute a small fraction of the total number in the *History*, which by one count tally at 141 \(a total that includes speeches in indirect, as well as direct, discourse\).9 This book also contains only “Athenian” speeches. That is not because the Athenians constitute the only side of the story worthy of attention, but because together their speeches open a win dow onto one partic u lar community’s influential and fascinat-ing, but also extraordinarily tendentious and slanted, vision of the world and of itself.10

The Athenian speeches, along with the Melian Dialogue, are so often read, studied, and cited today in large part for their pre sen ta tion of what has come to be known as the “Athenian thesis.” That thesis has two parts: first, it is the *very nature* of people and states \(and even gods\) xlvi

INTRODUCTION

to seek constantly to expand and exercise their power; second, they should not be blamed for doing so, seeing as it is simply human nature. A corollary to this thesis is that the abstract concept of moral justice has no real bearing in the realm of interstate relations. 

The first articulation of such a thesis appears in a speech made by Athenians in Sparta, to Spartans and other members of the Peloponnesian League, on the eve of the war \(that speech is not included here, but many of its points are repeated in speeches that are\). In Sparta, the Athenians argue that they simply acted in accordance with “ human nature” \(literally the “ human way”\) when they “accepted the empire that was handed to” them: We have done nothing extraordinary, nor beyond the realm of human nature, if we accepted an empire that was handed to us xlvii

INTRODUCTION

and refuse to give it up, hostage as we are to the three greatest motives of all: honor, fear, and self- interest. Nor indeed are we the first to behave like this, for it is a well-established rule that the weak are oppressed by the strong. \(1.76.2\) This line of argumentation sets an early and un-settling tone for Thucydides’ repre sen ta tion of the position of “the Athenians” and will be most explic itly reprised in the Melian Dialogue \(On Ruthlessness: The Melian Dialogue\), where they similarly argue, “ Those in positions of power do what their power permits, while the weak have no choice but to accept it” \(5.86\). It is simply the nature of the world that both gods and humans 

“always seek to rule wherever they can” \(5.105\). 

Due principally to the positions expressed in the Athenian speeches, in the aftermath of World War II Thucydides was adopted as a xlviii

INTRODUCTION

forefather of the international relations paradigm now known as Classical Realism. That paradigm regards nation- states as rational actors engaged in constant strug gles for power and security; it also assumes there is such a constant as “ human nature” that can be used to explain state be hav ior. The “Athenian thesis,” 

however, was not named as such until later, when University of Chicago phi los o pher Leo Strauss coined the phrase in his 1964 book *The City and the Man*. There Strauss read Thucydides’ *History* as a work of po liti cal philosophy and pronounced that “Thucydides sympathizes and makes us sympathize with politi cal greatness as displayed in fighting for freedom and in the founding, ruling, and expanding of empires.”11

Strauss’s readings of certain ancient Greek texts \(including also Plato’s *Republic* and Aristotle’s *Politics*\) were to become profoundly xlix

INTRODUCTION

influential, and today Straussian interpretations of Thucydides are often cited as foundations of American Neoconservative foreign policy. 

Neoconservatism was born of dissatisfaction with the Demo cratic Party’s “weak” foreign policy stance during the Vietnam War and the Cold War Era more generally: the first Neoconservatives supported socially liberal policy at home but still favored the containment of communism. By the mid-1990s \(during the Clinton administration\) leading “Neocon” thinkers were arguing that the United States’ post– Cold War international role should be one of “benev-olent global hegemony.”12

To many of these “second-wave Neocons” 

Thucydides’ *History* seemed to confirm the wisdom of the United States’ aggressive pro-motion of democracy and other national interests abroad, including by means of military might \(the Athenians, too, imposed democracy l

INTRODUCTION

on their allies; see “The Rise of the Athenian Empire” above\). In a 2003 essay, Irving Kristol, the “Godfather of Neoconservatism,” even called Thucydides’ *History* “the favorite Neoconservative text on foreign affairs,” a status that he attributed to the work of both Leo Strauss and Donald Kagan, a historian of classical Greece and conservative public intellectual at Yale.13 Kristol’s essay appeared just months after the 2003 U.S. invasion of Iraq; in the early years of the millennium Thucydides’ *History* was regularly invoked in justifications of the American invasions of and wars in Af ghan i stan and Iraq.14

Strauss himself, however, had read Thucydides as condemning the immoderation of classical Athens. He argued that Thucydides saw that regime as “defective” and also “did his best to prevent Pericles’ Funeral Speech from being mistaken for his own praise of Athens.”15 Many li

INTRODUCTION

have since read Thucydides as performing an implicit critique of the Athenians’ Realism, hawkishness, and imperialism, a critique that seems to materialize largely through what Edith Foster has called “contrasting narrative illustra-tions.”16 Pericles’ funeral oration \(“On Dying for Your Country: Pericles’ Funeral Oration”\), for example, celebrates an idealization of Athens, but after that speech Thucydides immediately turns to a gruesome account of the havoc wreaked there by the plague— a picture of the city at its lowest. He also places the display of Athenian ruthlessness in the Melian Dialogue not long before his two- book account of the catastrophe of the Sicilian Expedition \(see “On Launching a Foreign Invasion: The Sicilian Debate”\), during which the Athenians suffered, in a manner of speaking, the consequences of their own thesis. Such contrasts are evident, however, only if one takes into account the en-lii

INTRODUCTION

tirety of Thucydides’ *History*; speeches, after all, account for only about 25 percent of the text as a whole.17

Despite the currency that Thucydides’ name has acquired in American po liti cal discourse, biased po liti cal lenses serve to obscure rather than illuminate the text by magnifying partic u lar aspects and con ve niently obscuring others. In their own right, Thucydides’ Athenian speeches offer a complex picture of classical Athenian debates about empire, war, and the city’s place in the world. They also pres ent a deeply troubling set of views on the nature of human be hav ior, imperial power, interstate relations, the reconciliation of might and right, and the relationship between thought, word, and action. But while Thucydides’ speakers may perform explicit analy sis along these lines, the wisdom of their reflections— both in their specific historical context and more absolutely— 

liii

INTRODUCTION

will always remain a matter of debate. Nor should these speeches be read as evidence of what Thucydides himself believed: one must always bear in mind that, when Thucydides’ 

characters speak, “they are doing so with something to say, something to hide, something to achieve at a par tic u lar time and place.”18 This challenging combination of revelation and concealment is itself one of the reasons these speeches are rewarding reading today, when many of the points and prob lems they raise remain as urgent as ever. Nevertheless, the reader who turns to these speeches in search of practical ancient wisdom is strongly encouraged to do so with the ultimate fate of Thucydides’ 

Athens in mind.

HOW TO THINK ABOUT WAR

The Speeches

On Justifying a War: Pericles’ First War Speech \(432 BCE\)

The First Peloponnesian War concluded in 446 

with the Thirty Years’ Peace. By the time Pericles would have given this speech, however, Athens had already clashed with the Peloponnesian League again in vari ous proxy conflicts across Greece. Sparta regarded Athens in breach of the 446 treaty on several fronts and began to issue formal demands for concessions. 

When a last Spartan del e ga tion arrived in Athens bearing a final ultimatum— Sparta wanted peace but would go to war if Athens refused to allow the rest of the Greeks their autonomy— a meeting of the Athenian Assembly was called to deliberate what response the city would make. 

Many men spoke at that meeting, “some arguing 1

ON JUSTIFYING A WAR

that war was necessary,” others that compro-mises should be made in the interest of peace \(1.139\). In the end, though, Pericles prevailed on his fellow citizens to stand their ground as a matter of princi ple against the Peloponnesians’ 

demands, even if meant accepting the prospect of war. The Athenians “made a response to the Spartans just as he suggested, in both detail and spirit” and the Spartan “envoys left for home and were no longer sent to negotiate” \(1.145\).1

The themes and questions that Pericles raises in this, his first speech in the *History*, offer insight into how Athens had come to articulate its role and position in Greece and shed light on 

“Periclean” policy, at least as Thucydides understood it, perhaps partially in retrospect. Pericles’ 

arguments for why “command of the sea is a power ful thing” hearken back to Thucydides’ 

account early in the work of how the emergence of navies dramatically changed Greece \(1.8–15\) 2

ON JUSTIFYING A WAR

and the question of whether it is preferable to be, in modern terms, a “ whale” \(a sea power\) rather than an “elephant” \(a land power\) remains a point of debate today. This speech as a whole also represents an impressive lesson in how to deflect blame for inciting a war while si mul ta-neously formulating pretexts for one. 

Pericles does, however, issue the Athenians salutary warnings: the thrill of voting for war does not always carry over to the actual fight, and war itself should not be combined with attempts at territorial expansion. Knowing what we do now— and what Thucydides himself did then— about the long- term course of the war \(especially the fate of the Sicilian Expedition: see “On Launching a Foreign Invasion: The Sicilian Debate”\), it is difficult not to hear an ominous ring in Pericles’ memorable admonition to his fellow citizens: “I fear our own mistakes more than the enemy’s schemes.”

\[140\] Athenians, I have always maintained that we must not make concessions to the Peloponnesians, though I do realize that people are often more passionate when they are first convinced to go to war than when they actually wage it; that as circumstances change, so too does resolve. Now I see that I must give you the same, or virtually the same, counsel yet again, and I am going to insist that those of you now making up your minds either stand by our collective decisions, even if they lead us astray, or else take none of the credit for their wisdom if we do succeed. Events can unfold just as errantly as human intentions, which is why we so often blame bad luck when things fail to go as planned. 

It was clear before that the Spartans were plotting against us and that has become even clearer now. The terms of the treaty dictated 5

that we mutually submit and accept appeals for arbitration and that, in the meantime, each side be allowed to keep the territory it already has. 

They, however, have never sought arbitration; nor have they accepted our requests for it. They want to resolve this conflict by war, not diplo-macy, and have already taken to issuing orders in place of requests. They demand that we quit Potidaea, allow Aegina its in de pen dence, and repeal the Megarean Decree. Now these latest emissaries have come to proclaim that we have to let the Greeks be in de pen dent. 

Nobody here should think we will be going to war for nothing if we refuse to repeal the decree, the demand at the top of their list—if it is repealed, they claim, then there will be no war. 

Nor should anyone feel any lingering remorse about going to war over a matter so “small.” 

This minor issue actually encompasses within it the whole proof and test of your resolution.

If you capitulate to them, then they are just going to bully you over something bigger once they see you succumb in this instance to fear. 

But if you are firm, you will make it clear to them that they have to treat you as equals. 

\[141\] So, make up your minds at once: either to submit before harm comes to you or go to war \(in my opinion the better course\), be the pretext major or minor. Do not make concessions or act out of fear for our possessions. When neighbors circumvent procedure and start issuing demands, large or small, to their equals, it is always tantamount to the same thing: slavery. 

As to matters of war, and the means that both sides have available for it, if you listen to each of my points you will see that we are not in the weaker position. First of all, the Peloponnesians farm their own land and possess neither private nor public wealth. Second, they 9

have no experience of prolonged wars overseas because their poverty curtails even the conflicts they have with each other. They cannot outfit ships or deploy infantry because of the periods of absence and personal expense that doing so would require. What is more, they are cut off from the sea. State funds are better at sustaining wars than are compulsory private taxes and farmers will be quicker to volunteer their persons than their property for a war effort. 

They think they can rely on their bodies to prevail in the face of danger but worry that their resources will be exhausted if the war should drag out unexpectedly, as it is likely to do. 

The Peloponnesians might be able to hold their own against the rest of the Greeks in a one- off battle, but they cannot carry out a full-scale war unless it is against an enemy that has made comparable counter- preparations. That is because they are incapable of taking swift and 11

Some of them want most of all to exact vengeance on some enemy or other, while the last thing others want is to see their resources de-pleted. They rarely meet and when they do they spend very little time on matters of general concern and most of it maneuvering on behalf of their individual interests. Each member thinks that no harm will come from his own indifference, that vigilance is someone else’s responsi-bility. And because that is the approach they all quietly adopt, nobody realizes that the group’s common interests are being left to crumble.

are slow to levy it— and the hour of war waits for no man. Neither their effort to fortify our territory nor their naval fleet is worth fearing. 

Even in peacetime it is no easy task to build fortifications in a hostile city- state and it is certainly no easier in war, especially when you have a formidable enemy also establishing bases within your own borders. If they really are going to set up a garrison here, the incursions and consequent slave desertions might well damage some of our land. That will not, however, be sufficient to prevent us from building our own fortifications in their territory; nor will it keep us from sailing our ships against them, which is our strong suit. 

Furthermore, our naval experience is more applicable to land than their land experience is to naval matters, and it will be no easy thing for them to gain mastery over the sea. You yourselves have been striving at that ever since the 15

sailors with the prospect of better pay. That strategy would only work if we were unworthy adversaries for lack of citizens and resi-dents to man our ships. But we are in fact strong in that re spect, and, most importantly, we can boast more and better qualified native helms-men and crews than the rest of Greece put together. In any case, none of our mercenaries would, at such a high risk, be willing to abandon his country to fight on the side with worse odds of winning just for a few days’ worth of good pay. 

That is more or less how I see the Peloponnesians’ situation. Our own position, by contrast, seems free of the weaknesses that I have outlined in theirs and has unique advantages besides. If they invade our country on foot, we will invade theirs by sea. It would be worse for them to see even a part of the Peloponnese rav-ished than for us to have all Attica destroyed.

They would be left with no other land except what they might win in battle, while we have plenty more territory on the islands and the mainland. Command of the sea is a power ful thing. 

Just think: if we were islanders, it would be nearly impossible to catch us\! From here on out that is the mindset that we need to adopt. Forget your land and your houses; think only of guarding sea and city. You must not enter into a fight on land with the Peloponnesians, who greatly outnumber us, out of anger at losing your possessions. If we engage them on land and win, we will have to fight just as many of them again; if we lose we will also lose our allies. They are the source of our strength but will also give us no peace if we are powerless to march against them. Weep not for the loss of homes and property but only for the loss of lives. Homes and property, after all, do not 21

Those are points that I will discuss in another speech when the time is right. 

For now, we must send the emissaries away with the following message: we will restore access to our markets and harbors to Megara only when the Spartans have ended their alien acts and quit expelling our citizens and allies \(nothing in the treaty precludes any of these things\).

And we will let the Greek city- states be in depen dent, provided that they were in de pen dent when we swore the treaty, once the Spartans have restored in de pen dence to their own cities and allowed them to ally with whomever they wish. Tell them we are happy to follow the procedures outlined in the agreement and will not start a war but will indeed fight if they initiate one. This is a just and fitting answer for our city to make. 

We need to accept that war is necessary, and if we are willing to face that fact then we will find our enemies less resolute. We should further acknowledge that, for cities and individuals alike, the reward of im mense danger is im mense honor. Our fathers, as you know, set out to resist the Persians not only with lesser resources but even once those resources had been exhausted. It was with acumen rather than luck, 25

On Dying for Your Country: Pericles’ 

Funeral Oration \(431/0 BCE\)

After just fourteen years, the Thirty Years’ 

Peace came to an end on a moonless, rainy night in the spring of 431. War preparations began with general enthusiasm, especially among the youth, and “all Greece hung in suspense as it awaited the conflict of its two greatest cities” 

\(2.8\). Thucydides reports that sympathies lay primarily with the Peloponnesians and hopes ran high that Greece might be restored to liberty from Athenian rule. He also tells of how Archidamus, the Spartan king and general, nevertheless warned his troops of the challenges that lay ahead: though Greece might be with them, the course of war is always impossible to predict; Athens was a mighty power and the Athenians would mount an equally mighty defense \(2.11\). 

29

ON DYING FOR YOUR COUNTRY

In Athens, Pericles urged his fellow citizens not to march out to meet their enemies but to prepare to defend from within the city walls. 

The people of rural Attica abandoned their homes and took crowded refuge in the city. Archidamus began his invasion in late spring, but to his confusion the Athenians made no coun-termove; despite the people’s bitter protestations, Pericles insisted that they continue to watch and wait. Meanwhile, crews from the Athenian navy sacked villages around the Peloponnese and occupied the nearby island of Aegina. Fi nally, in late summer, Pericles led an army— the biggest force Athens had marshalled yet— against Megara, the quarrels over whose exclusion from the ports of the Athenian Empire were mentioned in the previous speech \(see also introduction, “The Peloponnesian War”\). 

In Athens that winter, at the end of the campaign season, Pericles delivered a customary 30

ON DYING FOR YOUR COUNTRY

funeral oration for the war dead. The tradition of doing so is thought to have originated in the years or de cades following the Persian Wars; before the Peloponnesian War, Pericles had already delivered at least one such oration, in ca. 

439, over Athenians who had died in the campaign against Samos \(only short quotations from that speech survive\). As Thucydides has it, Pericles devoted most of his funeral oration in 431/0 to an account of the exceptionalism of the Athenian *politeia*— a word related to *polis* \(“city-state”\) and that gives us En glish “polity,” 

but whose semantic range in Ancient Greek covered the entire remit of the state, from its institutions and government to its citizenry and civic life. In short, a state’s *politeia* is its “constitution” in all senses of the word. In the mid- fourth century bce the Athenian intellectual Isocrates remarked that “the soul of a city is none other than its *politeia*” \( *Areopagiticus* §14\).2

31

ON DYING FOR YOUR COUNTRY

Pericles’ funeral oration prob ably constitutes the best- known section of the entire *History*. 

Since the nineteenth century, the speech has often been read as a kind of manifesto for the values of vari ous nations and even the “West” 

as a whole. Quotations from it were plastered on London buses during the First World War, and throughout much of the Cold War extracts were blasted nightly from loudspeakers in Athens as part of the touristic “Acropolis Sound and Light Show.” For its encomium of democracy, the speech has been quoted by countless politicians; for the same reason, in 1937 the regime of the Greek dictator Ioannis Metaxas issued an order banning it from study in schools. 

Pericles’ funeral oration offers a challenging and eloquent prose- hymn of the Athenian ideal. 

In its context, however, the task of the speech— 

and of all Athenian funeral orations— was ultimately one of affirming that the ideal itself was 32

ON DYING FOR YOUR COUNTRY

worth dying for. The following translation begins with the chapter in which Thucydides describes the tradition of the public funeral that preceded the oration.

this oration on the assumption that it is a fine thing for a speech to be pronounced over the war dead. Personally, I should have thought that honors rendered with actions, such as the or ga nized state funeral you are now witnessing, would have sufficed for men who had proven their bravery by actions, and that proper recognition of the merits of many should not depend on a single man whose speech might go well or poorly. 

It is a difficult task indeed to strike the right tone when the very plausibility of what you are saying is under scrutiny. Even an informed and sympathetic listener might find the speech insufficient on points he considers impor tant and with which he is familiar, while someone unversed in these things might, out of envy, think some of it too extreme should he hear about achievements beyond his own capabilities. After all, people can only stand listening to praise of others so long as they think they might merit the same, whereas 39

\[36\] I will begin first with our ancestors, for it is right and fitting that we honor their memory on this occasion. They dwelt continuously in this land, generation after generation, and by virtue of their excellence handed it down a free one still today. They deserve praise, but our fathers even more so, for beyond what they had inherited they secured the empire that we now possess and which they passed down to us at great effort. Those of us here now and not yet past our primes have also been responsible for expanding most parts of that empire and have ensured that the city is entirely capable of providing for itself in times of both peace and war.

As to personal reputation, whoever wins esteem for some reason can advance in public affairs— not by turn, but through merit. And as to poverty, no one who is able to perform a good ser vice for the city is prevented by his humble station from doing so.

As for education, in other socie ties they begin arduous training for manhood right from youth. We, by contrast, lead more leisurely lives, but are nevertheless just as capable of confronting equally formidable dangers. This is the proof: the Spartans have not invaded our land alone but have come with all their allies, whereas we have no difficulty invading a neighboring country by ourselves and are typically victorious on foreign soil, where our opponents are fighting to defend their own property. 

In fact, no enemy has ever faced our full combined forces because we take such pains with our navy and dispatch infantry to so many places.

We are the only ones who do not see lack of public participation as minding your own business: we regard such non- participants as useless. We also take care to decide—or at least carefully deliberate on— 

public 

matters for 

ourselves, for we do not see discussion as an impediment to action but think it worse to act precipitously without the benefit of first informing ourselves by prior debate. We are unique, too, in that we strive to be at once daring and reflective in our planning; elsewhere boldness is attended by ignorance or else over-analysis breeds hesitation to act. Those who fully grasp the difference between what should be feared and what should be savored and do not shrink from danger because of it would rightly be judged the stoutest of heart.

Our approach to good deeds is also the opposite of most other people’s: we make friends not by receiving favors but by granting them. Admit-tedly, the granter of the favor is the surer friend, in that the kindness he showed means that he retains a right to the other’s gratitude. The recipient, by contrast, is usually less enthusiastic, since he knows that it is not really a favor that he must repay but a debt of obligation. Nevertheless, we are the only people who aid others not out of some calculation of self- interest, but out of fearlessness, and with faith in our own liberty.

real truth of the matter is borne out by the city’s power, which we have attained because of the very traits that I have described. For our city is the only one that, when put to the test, proves even greater than its reputation would suggest. It is also the only one that enemies on the attack never resent for the manner of men who bring about their defeat and that subject states never accuse of being unworthy to rule. 

We enjoy admiration now and will continue to do so in future generations because we bear witness to our power with great monuments. 

We have no need, then, of a Homer’s praise, nor of anyone to entertain us momentarily with poetic verses and claims that can only ever be un-dermined by the actual truth of matters. By our daring we have made the whole sea and earth ours to traverse and have established everlasting monuments to both our reprisals and our benefactions in all corners of the world.

This right has cancelled out any past wrongs, for the ser vice that they rendered collectively means more than any harm they did as individuals. 

None of these men’s resolve grew weak at the thought of their wealth and the sustained pleasures it promised, nor did any of them attempt to stave off danger because of poverty and their aspirations of one day escaping it and becoming rich. Instead they desired, more than anything else, to have vengeance against their enemies. And because they saw the risk that this would require as the most glorious one of all, with that thought in mind they resolved to seek their satisfaction and put off any other concerns. They consigned the uncertainty of success to hope and deci ded it best to have faith 61

Understanding full well that their lot was one of re sis tance and suffering and not one of survival purchased by surrender, the one thing they fled was dishonor itself.

On Holding the Course: Pericles’ 

Last Speech \(430 BCE\)

In the summer of 430, a devastating plague, perhaps akin to typhoid fever, broke out in Athens. Thucydides reports that it was thought to have originated in Ethiopia; the disease then spread through Egypt and Libya and much of Persia before entering Athens through the port of Piraeus. The war time advent of refugees into Athens from the Attic countryside only exac-erbated the effects of the plague, which would eventually claim Pericles \(Thucydides fell ill but survived\). Thucydides notes that despair per-meated the city, which descended into a degree of anarchy \(2.47–55\). 

The Peloponnesians, meanwhile, continued their assault on Attica. In response, Pericles readied an armada of a hundred ships for dispatch to the Peloponnese where it laid waste to 75

ON HOLDING THE COURSE

a number of towns. The Peloponnesians then abandoned Attica after an assault that had lasted about forty days— their second attack on Athenian home territory and the longest of the war. 

In the wake of that invasion, the distressed Athenians began to “change their minds” and to blame Pericles for what had befallen them, 

“given that he had persuaded them to go to war and it was because of him that they were suffering so much” \(2.59\). They even sent envoys to Sparta to negotiate peace, but those efforts failed. Pericles called an assembly at which he supposedly delivered this speech, his last in Thucydides’ *History*, in the hopes of allaying his countrymen’s fears and convincing them to stay the course and resist the temptation to surrender. His pleas were successful, and the 76

ON HOLDING THE COURSE

Athenians resolved to endure— but also to punish Pericles with a fine. Despite that, he was eventually reelected general, but he died of the plague less than a year later. 

Here Pericles reprises earlier themes of his: the advantages of Athenian naval power and the duty of Athenians to preserve the glory and good name that their forefathers had sacrificed so much to establish. He also reasserts the necessity of full civic engagement for citizens who belong to a city— and imperial power— such as Athens. Those who would practice “apo liti cal” 

detachment from public affairs \(i.e., the Athenian vice of *apragmosynē*\) actually pose the greatest danger to the state. He further implies that peace, at this point, is impracticable, for 

“even if it was wrong to establish the empire in 77

ON HOLDING THE COURSE

the first place, letting it go now would be exceptionally dangerous” \(1.63\). 

In the section of the *History* that immediately follows this speech \(a passage known as Pericles’ “obituary”\), Thucydides will speculate 78

ON HOLDING THE COURSE

that the Athenians might not have lost the war had Pericles survived. There he will praise Pericles’ moderation in the more peaceful era when Athenian power was at its height and assert the wisdom of his leadership and policy in war.

I am convinced that people are much better off when their whole city is flour-ishing than when certain citizens prosper but the community has gone off course. When a man is doing well for himself but his country is falling to pieces he goes to pieces along with it, but a struggling individual has much better hopes if his country is thriving.

Someone who knew what we should do but was incapable of explaining it would clearly be just as useless as someone who had never given the matter any thought; if he could do both but was unfriendly toward the city, he could never act as a sincere advocate on its behalf; if, fi nally, he was a true patriot but still susceptible to bribery, then every thing would be up for sale. So, if you believed that I, as opposed to anyone else, possessed some modicum of all of these qualities when you took my advice and first went to war, then it makes no sense for me to face accusations of wrongdoing now.

You are entirely in command of one of them— the sea— inasmuch as you control it already, but you could be even more so if you wanted to. There is no one, neither the King of Persia nor any nation on earth, who could stop you from sailing with the naval outfit you currently possess.

Think of those things as you would a little garden— wealth’s mere frills— and value them just as little. Know too that freedom, which we will preserve by our efforts, will easily recover all that, but people who surrender tend to lose even what little they had left. On both counts, then, you must prove yourselves no worse than your fathers, for it was through their own efforts and nobody else’s that they attained all this and preserved it to hand down to you. After all, it is even more shameful to be stripped of what you have than it is to fail at attempts to acquire more. 

You need, then, to go to face your enemies with a spirit not merely of courage but of contempt.

Citizens who refused to take part in such matters would, once they had convinced others to join them, quickly ruin the state, even if they just kept to themselves and led their lives entirely at a remove. One person’s disengagement is un-tenable unless bolstered by someone else’s commitment.

On Realpolitik: The Mytilenean Debate \(427 BCE\)

During the fourth summer of the war, in 428, Mytilene, a city on the eastern Aegean island of Lesbos, led an attempt at secession from alliance with Athens. At great expense and with help from the other allies, the Athenians blockaded the island. Meanwhile, at a cele bration of the Olympics, Mytilenean envoys made a plea to the Peloponnesians. They cited Athens’ un-trustworthiness and tyrannical treatment of its allies and outlined the practical benefits that an alliance with Mytilene would bring \(3.9–14\). 

Sparta was persuaded. By the end of the winter, the Spartans dispatched a man named Salaethus ahead to Mytilene, where he informed the local leaders that relief was on its way. The Mytileneans were heartened and so ceased 101

ON REALPOLITIK

to negotiate with Athens. The next summer, in 427, Sparta dispatched a fleet of forty- two ships to Mytilene and si mul ta neously launched another, even more destructive, invasion of Attica \(3.25–6\). 

The Spartan ships, however, were delayed in reaching Mytilene. Salaethus gave up on wait-ing for them and distributed arms to the suffering people so that they might rise up against Athens. The people instead turned against the ruling oligarchs and threatened to deliver the city up to Athens if stored-up food was not distributed. Powerless to do anything, the oligarchs joined with the people and surrendered to Paches, the Athenian general in control of the island, on the condition that they be permitted to send an embassy to Athens to make their case there \(3.28\). Eventually, Paches apprehended Salaethus and extradited both him and 102

ON REALPOLITIK

the Mytilenean oligarchs he thought responsible for the revolt to Athens. Salaethus was at once put to death; after a debate, the Athenians resolved not only to execute the rest of the pris-oners but also to kill all of the men of Mytilene and enslave the women and children. They dispatched a trireme to the island bearing those orders \(3.35–6\). 

The next day, however, they reconsidered and realized that they had made a “brutal decision to destroy the entire city, instead of just the guilty parties.” Mytilenean envoys worked together with certain sympathetic Athenians to reopen the matter. In the assembly meeting that followed, one of the leading speakers was Cleon, the son of Cleaenetus, a notorious demagogue 

“who had prevailed in his earlier motion for the death penalty, and was generally the most violent of all the citizens and the most effective 103

ON REALPOLITIK

at persuading the people” \(3.36\). We know nothing, by contrast, of Diodotus, the son of Eucrates, who is Cleon’s opponent in this debate. 

Cleon begins his speech with the provocative point that a democracy is incapable of running an empire; he also, however, calls Athens’ empire a tyranny, just as Pericles— a leader so differ ent in character— had done in his last speech \(2.63; see On Holding the Course: Pericles’ Last Speech\). He then issues a warning about the dangers of spectacular oratory and goes on to argue that destroying Mytilene will be both objectively just \(given the Mytileneans’ crime\) and advantageous for Athens. Diodotus, too, frames his position in terms of Athenian interests, but contends that inflicting such a harsh punishment on Mytilene will ultimately bring the greatest harm upon Athens itself. He emphasizes the 104

ON REALPOLITIK

wisdom of the deliberative pro cess \(as Pericles had done in his Funeral Oration: 2.40; see “On Dying for Your Country: Pericles’ Funeral Oration”\) and its power to signal the purpose with which Athens acts. 

Like the Melian Dialogue \(“On Ruthlessness: The Melian Dialogue”\), this debate is often read as a key document in the history of po liti cal Realism. Both Cleon’s and Diodotus’ 

speeches are structured by reflections on how concerns for “justice” \( *to dikaion*\) and “expediency” \( *to sumpheron*\) ought to be weighed in matters of foreign policy. Cleon insists that mercy and leniency are detrimental to empire, but in his speech Diodotus never claims that the Mytileneans should be spared on purely ethical grounds \(Cleon’s speech may, however, imply that Diodotus had previously made that case\): Diodotus’ argument is not that killing 105

ON REALPOLITIK

the Mytileneans would be unjust, but that it would be disadvantageous to Athens. But Thucydides’ narrative suggests that certain Athenians were indeed morally opposed to the 

“brutal decision to destroy the entire city.”

This is a point of which he subtly, but significantly, reminds us immediately after the debate, when he alludes to the heavy hearts of the rowers initially dispatched to bear the bad news to Mytilene \(3.49\).

The worst thing that could happen would be for nothing that we resolve to have any mean-ing, and for us to fail to recognize that a city is stronger when it has inferior but unbendable laws than when it has good laws with no real authority. Ignorance coupled with self- restraint is more advantageous than intelligence that knows no checks, and simpler people are usually better than smarter ones at running cities. 

That is because intelligent people like to appear wiser than the laws and come out on top in public debates, in the belief that there will be no better occasion for demonstrating just how clever they are. The result is that they are often their cities’ undoing. On the other hand, people with less confidence in their own intelligence think that the laws know best and that they are unqualified to criticize the words of a good 111

Obviously, someone must be quite confident in his own speaking abilities if he is going to contend that things which were most certainly deci ded never actually were—or else he must be so corrupted by bribes that he has worked to come up with a reasonable- sounding speech to mislead you. 

In these kinds of contests, the city awards the prizes to others but assumes all of the risks. You have no one to blame but yourselves for institut-ing such misguided competitions, for you have a habit of treating speeches as spectacles and of listening passively to tales of action. You form your ideas about what is going to happen entirely on the basis of what skilled speakers say, and when you reflect on what has already tran-spired you are just as likely to put faith in what you hear from renowned orators as you are to believe your own eyes.

In doing so they deci ded to rank force ahead of justice. They attacked us at a moment when they thought they could win and not when they had been wronged. Cities tend to become insolent when they are suddenly visited by unexpected good fortune. It is usually safer for people to thrive within mea sure and not beyond all reason. Hardship is easier to fend off, so to speak, than prosperity is to maintain. 

Back then we should have held the Mytileneans in no higher esteem than anyone else and they never would have grown so impertinent.

Just think: if you lay down the same punishment for allies forced to rebel by our enemies as you do on those who revolt of their own free will, who then will hesitate to revolt on the slightest excuse, when freedom is the prize for success and the mistake will not be fatal if they try but fail? We will have to put our lives and resources on the line for every single territory. 

And these places will be ruined once we subdue them, which means that we will be deprived of the rest of the revenue we so depend on.

And leniency should only be shown to people who will be helpful in the future, not granted to people who will remain ever as they are and never become any less hostile to us than they are now. 

In short, what I am saying is this: if you listen to me, you will be dealing with the Mytileneans both as they deserve and in a way that is to our own advantage. But if you decide other wise, you will not be doing them a favor so much as inflicting punishment on yourselves. 

For if they were right to revolt, then you are wrong to rule. But if you do want to rule regardless, fair or unfair your best interest demands that you punish them. Other wise give up the empire and go parade your self- righteousness where there is no real danger involved.

Punish them, then, with the same penalty that they tried to impose on you, and do not give any indication that you are any less resent-ful than they are now that you have escaped their plots. Keep in mind what they would have done to you had they been successful, especially given that they were the ones who committed the first offense. People who wrong others for no good reason tend to keep at it until they finish the job, in the worry that their enemies will become a danger to them down the road. An innocent person who has been made to suffer is much more difficult to deal with, if he escapes, than an enemy merely taking tit for tat. 

Do not betray yourselves. Revert as much as you can to the mindset you had when you were actually suffering and you thought that suppressing the revolt was your greatest priority.

Anyone who maintains that we have nothing useful to learn from listening to speeches either lacks sense or has a secret agenda at stake. He lacks sense if he thinks there is any other way of discussing the future’s uncertainties; he has something at stake if his aim is to persuade people to do something dishonorable but he thinks he cannot actually give a good speech in the interest of a bad cause—so by making compelling false accusations he presumes that he can take both his opponents and audience by surprise. 

The trickiest cases, though, are when people accuse someone of presenting something a certain way because he has taken a bribe. If they merely charged him with ignorance, at least then he would gain a reputation for stupidity rather than dishonesty should he fail to persuade.

But when someone is accused of corruption he attracts suspicion even if he wins his case. And if he fails to win, people think that he is stupid in addition to being corrupt. 

The city gains nothing in such instances when, because of fear, it deprives itself of advi-sors. In fact, a city would be best off if these kinds of citizens were terrible speakers because then it would be less likely to be induced to making mistakes. A good citizen should not try to intimidate his opponents but to prove himself the better speaker fair and square, and a sensible city should neither heap honors on the best adviser nor act to lessen the esteem he already enjoys. By the same token, someone whose opinion does not prevail should not suffer disgrace, let alone punishment. If that were the case, good speakers would be disinclined to go against their personal beliefs and say what-ever is popu lar in hopes of becoming famous.

\[43\] Here, though, we do just the opposite and, what is more, when someone is suspected of acting for profit, no matter how valuable his advice we get so jealous at the mere intimation of private gain that we are willing to deprive the city of the obvious benefit of his counsel. We are by habit just as suspicious of good advice as we are of bad, the result being that speakers who seek to urge horrific courses of action use deceit to win people over. On the other hand, people who actually have good counsel to offer need to lie just to be believed. This is the only place where quick- wittedness makes it impossible to enjoy success openly and without any need for deceit because anyone who does something good publicly is suspected of ulterior motives.

And this is what Cleon so forcefully maintains: that, going forward, it will be in our own best interest to deter revolts by passing down this sentence of death. I, on the other hand, am absolutely certain that if we are really concerned about our future then the opposite holds true. I do not, moreover, think that you should discard my argument’s practicality because of the specious allure of his. After all, his position might seem a more just response to your current anger against Mytilene. But we are not taking them to trial and weighing matters of absolute justice; we are deliberating about them and how they can be of use.

\[45\] Cities impose the death penalty for vari-ous reasons and not only in cases like this; they do so for more minor offenses, too. Nevertheless, hope still drives people to take risks, and people never throw themselves in danger’s way when their prior calculations have already fore-told defeat. Likewise, has any rebelling city ever attempted this kind of revolt in the belief that it had failed to make sufficient preparations, whether alone or with help from allies? 

People naturally make mistakes as both individuals and states and no law will ever prevent this. The proof is that humans have experi-mented with every pos si ble punishment in the hopes of guarding themselves from potential wrongdoers. Long ago, there were most likely more lenient sentences for the most serious offenses but, over time, as people continued to commit those offenses, the death penalty became more common. Yet people still do wrong 143

despite it, so either we need to scare them with an even more terrifying punishment or just accept that it is no deterrent. Poverty begets boldness out of sheer necessity; power, with all of its arrogance and pride, leads to greed. In other circumstances dif fer ent passions hold people in their mighty, incurable thrall and spur them to take risks. 

In every case, though, hope and desire— the one leading, the other following; the one undertaking the planning, the other whispering that success will come easy— are the most harmful forces of all. They might be invisible, but they are mightier than any terrors that can be seen. 

In addition to these, luck plays just as important a role in motivating people. It can turn up when least expected and drive people to take risks even if they lack the necessary resources.

\[46\] All of this means that we should not make a poor decision based on our trust that the death penalty is a deterrent; nor should we eliminate all hope in the rebels by signaling that there is no point in them repenting and putting an end to their misstep as quickly as pos si ble. 

Just think that now, when a rebelling city realizes that it cannot succeed, it still has a chance to come to an agreement with us by assenting to repay our expenditure and pay tribute after that. But if things are other wise, is it not the case that they will only make better preparations and hold out under siege until the very 147

Does it not ultimately hurt us to for-sake all this money by refusing to come to an agreement—or, if we win, to conquer a devastated territory, and lose all future income from it? That kind of revenue is precisely what gives us our strength against our enemies. 

We must not, then, think of ourselves as strict judges here and in doing so injure ourselves more than we injure those actually at fault. Instead, we have to see how, by punishing them with moderation, we can exploit these cities as sources of income going forward. We must also resolve to seek protection not in the sever-ity of our laws but in the diligence with which we act. Now we do the opposite, for when we subdue a free state that is ruled against its will and which has revolted— 

understandably—to 

reclaim its own autonomy, we think the punishment must be severe. We must not excessively 149

\[47\] Consider, too, another aspect of the mistake you would be making by listening to Cleon. Right now, throughout the allied cities, the people are well- disposed toward you. They either refuse to rebel with the oligarchs or, if they are forced to join in, they immediately become enemies of the rebels. That means that when a city revolts you have the majority of the people with you as allies in the fight. But if you obliterate the people of Mytilene, who never actually took part in the revolt and who, once they got ahold of arms, willingly handed the city over to you, you will not merely be acting 151

unjustly by killing your own benefactors: you will also be crafting exactly the circumstances that those in power desire most. From now on, the people will join in at once when the power-ful few lead their cities in revolt, for this case will have already established that the same punishment awaits the guilty and innocent alike. 

But even if the people had been guilty in this case, you would need to proceed as if they were not, in order to avoid turning our one remaining ally into an enemy. 

I think that it will be much more expedient for keeping our empire if we pursue this strategy, namely of agreeing to suffer an injustice, as opposed to annihilating— however justly— 

those whom we should not. You will find that, despite what Cleon claims, in this case it is impossible for justice and expediency to go hand in hand in punishment.

On Ruthlessness: The Melian 

Dialogue \(416 BCE\)

In 425, Athens had refused the Spartans’ attempts to make peace in the wake of their humiliating surrenders in the battles of Pylos and Sphacteria \(4.38–40\). When Cleon and the Spartan general Brasidas, “the men on each side most opposed to peace,” were both killed at Amphipolis in 422, the Spartan king Pleistoanax and Athenian general Nicias intensified their efforts to forge a treaty \(5.16\). The 421 “Peace of Nicias” 

marked a de facto Athenian victory in the Archidamian War and dictated a fifty- year truce 

“on land and on sea” between Athens, Sparta, and their respective allies \(5.18\). Aristophanes’ 

comedy *Peace* premiered at the festival of the City Dionysia just days before the treaty was formally ratified; in it, the main Athenian character 159

ON RUTHLESSNESS

anticipates a joyous cele bration of a return to peace after a wearing de cade of war. 

Conflicts between Spartan and Athenian allies nevertheless continued to flare up in the Peloponnese. In 418, Athens and a new co ali tion of allies from the Peloponnesian peninsula— 

Argos, Elis, and Mantinea— were roundly defeated by Sparta at the Battle of Mantinea \(5.65–75\). As Nicias would later note before the Athenian Assembly on the eve of the Sicilian Expedition, his “Peace” had quickly become one “only in name” \(6.10; see “On Launching a Foreign Invasion: The Sicilian Debate”\). 

The Battle of Mantinea is the last major event that Thucydides narrates before he turns his attention to the Athenian siege of the island of Melos, a small Aegean island north of the Sea of Crete and southeast of the Peloponnese. In the winter of 416, the Athenians launched an expedition— with 38 ships, 2,700 hoplites, and 160

ON RUTHLESSNESS

hundreds of archers— against the island, which had originally been established as a Spartan colony. Thucydides tells us that “they, like the other islanders, had not wanted to be subjugated to Athens.” When Athens and Sparta went to war the Melians had attempted to remain neutral, but after the Athenians invaded and devastated their lands the Melians naturally took sides against them \(5.84\). 

The Athenians sent representatives to negotiate with the Melians and Thucydides pres ents the “Melian Dialogue” as a transcript of that final meeting. It differs from the other se lections in this volume in two impor tant ways. First, it unfolds as a \(sometimes rapid- fire\) dialogue rather than as a speech or set of speeches; even in the manuscripts it is the only passage of Thucydides’ *History* to be laid out like a dramatic script. Second, the conference between the Athenians and Melians was held in private, 161

ON RUTHLESSNESS

on Melos; Thucydides’ source would have had to have been the reports of the Athenian emissaries who participated in the negotiations. The dialogue is, however, often suspected of being largely Thucydides’ invention. 

By Thucydides’ account, the meeting on Melos ended with the Melians refusing to surrender and the Athenians issuing a final warning that the Melians’ decision would prove “a grave mistake.” Both sides followed through on their promises— the Athenians to keep up their siege, and the Melians to resist it. When at last Melos had no choice but to surrender, the Athenians fulfilled their own prophecy of the Melians’ doom: “They seized and killed all the adult males and sold the women and children to slavery” \(5.116\). 

Athens had apparently presented Melos with a true dilemma: surrender or be obliterated. 

Right from the start of the dialogue, the Athe-162

ON RUTHLESSNESS

nian emissaries establish that matters of abstract justice will not be taken into consideration. Yet here, as with the previous chapter’s Mytilenean Debate, the concepts of “justice” and “advantage/expediency” are repeatedly foregrounded. 

Today, the dialogue is often cited as the first 

“Realist- Idealist” debate; we also find in it the clearest articulation of the so- called “Athenian thesis” that both gods and mortals “always seek to rule wherever they can” \(see introduction, 

“The Athenian Thesis”\). 

Yet the debate’s appearance in the *History* so soon before the narrative of the catastrophic failure of the Sicilian Expedition serves to foreground the Athenians’ drift into both cruelty and folly. After all, a de cade or so earlier they had deci ded to spare most of the population of Mytilene—if only on second thoughts and at the eleventh hour.

Upholding this princi ple is in your own interest too, for if you were ever to be defeated you would suffer enormous reprisals and be made an example for others.

Sicily, part of the “Greek West,” had been a theater of war between Athens and Syracuse in the mid-420s, but even after the two cities made peace in 424 the Athenians continued to worry that Syracuse would join in alliance with Sparta. 

By 415, Athens and its population had begun to recover from the war and plague of the previous de cade. It was then that a pretext for a large- scale invasion of Sicily arrived in the form of an appeal for help from Segesta, a former Athenian ally. Segesta had recently lost a battle against Selinunte, another Sicilian city and ally of Syracuse, Athens’ old enemy and imperial 201

rival on the island. Books 6 and 7 of Thucydides’ 

*History* are devoted to a narrative of Athens’ 

Sicilian Expedition: from the city’s decision to undertake it \(motivated, Thucydides explains, by the Athenians’ desire to conquer the whole of the wealthy island\), the departure of the troops, the course of the fighting, and the Athenians’ eventual, spectacular defeat. 

Early in Book 6, Thucydides pres ents an account of a debate held in the Athenian Assembly on the expedition’s eve. He offers versions of three speeches made on the occasion: a first speech by Nicias advising against the invasion, a counterspeech by Alcibiades affirming his enthusiasm for it, and another speech by Nicias. 

Both Nicias and Alcibiades had already been voted commanders of the expedition \(the third general was Lamachus, who would die in Sicily early on in the fighting\). Nicias was a se nior 202

ON LAUNCHING AN INVASION

general and statesman and had been largely responsible for brokering the peace that bore his name. Alcibiades had, a few years earlier, managed to build an alliance of Peloponnesian cities against Sparta— though the alliance was roundly defeated at the Battle of Mantinea in 418 \(see also the introduction to “On Ruthlessness: The Melian Dialogue”\). He was a hand-some and wealthy playboy in his mid-30s, a member of Athens’ most renowned aristocratic family. When Alcibiades’ father died early in his childhood, Pericles, a relative, became one of his guardians. 

In his speech to the Assembly in 432, Pericles had warned his fellow Athenians not to “mix war with attempts to expand the empire or contrive additional dangers for yourselves” \(1.144; see “On Justifying a War: Pericles’ First War Speech”\). Alcibiades was of a dif fer ent character 203

ON LAUNCHING AN INVASION

from his guardian. Ambitious and bold, he inspired his fellow Athenians with a new eager-ness to expand their empire’s reach. Thus it was that, in the summer of 415, the Athenians launched their invasion of Sicily and bade fare-well to a fleet of well over a hundred ships bearing some 5,000 men. 

The period of preparations had, however, been ill- omened. On a night soon before the troops departed, several statues of the god Hermes \(“herms”\) were mutilated. Alcibiades was suspected of involvement, but the Athenians deci ded not to bring him to trial before the fleet’s departure. In his absence, further accusations quickly mounted against him, including a charge that he had been plotting to overthrow the democracy. In the autumn he was recalled to Athens, but he managed to escape the convoy dispatched to Sicily to retrieve 204

ON LAUNCHING AN INVASION

him. He immediately defected to Sparta, and Thucydides relates that he there delivered a speech informing the Spartans of the Athenians’ plans in Sicily \(6.89–92\). Alcibiades also warned the Spartans that Athens would succeed in conquering the island if they failed to intervene. Thanks to his urging, the Spartans sent troops, commanded by Gylippus, to the west. They arrived just in time to rescue the flailing Syracusans and turn the war’s tide against Athens. 

The expedition ended in 413, but not before the Spartans had made another declaration of war against Athens at home. In Sicily, the Athenian forces were all but annihilated; those few who survived were imprisoned, then enslaved, and “few men out of so many ever saw their homecoming day” \(7.87\). Nicias had surrendered himself to Gylippus in the hopes that his 205

ON LAUNCHING AN INVASION

men would be spared; he was, however, executed \(against Gylippus’ wishes\) and Thucydides calls him the “least deserving of the Greeks of my day to suffer such a terrible fate” \(7.86\). At home, the people of Athens were stunned when they learned of what had happened. According to Plutarch’s *Life of Nicias* \(§30\), when a stranger unwittingly broke news—in a barber-shop at the port—of what had befallen the expedition, the Athenians were so unwilling to believe the report that the barber who carried 206

ON LAUNCHING AN INVASION

the tidings was tortured until messengers arrived and confirmed the story. 

The “total destruction” \(7.87\) of the Athenian forces at Sicily did not spell the end of the war. 

Toward the start of Book 8, Thucydides writes that, in the wake of the expedition, “all of Greece immediately rose up against Athens” 

\(8.2\). Soon, “both sides were preparing for war, exactly as they had done before, back at its beginning” \(8.5\).

long as you commit no act of aggression the treaty will stand, if only in name \(for that is precisely what certain people, both here and among the enemy, have reduced it to\). If, however, we make some misstep, our enemies will be swift to marshal a major force and to launch their attack. After all, the accord only came about in the first place because of catastrophes they suffered—it was their disgrace, not ours, that forced this agreement— and there are still many unresolved issues with the terms. In fact, certain states, and extremely power ful ones at that, have yet to sign. Some of them make open war against us while others are held at bay by series of ten- day treaties, and only because Sparta has been hesitant to make a move. It may very well be that if they see our forces divided— 

exactly the direction we are hurtling in— they will ally with the Sicilians, whom in earlier days 213

they would have valued as allies more than practically anyone else. 

One therefore ought to take all this into account and not risk so much on invading so lofty a city or on striving for an even larger empire before we can be confident in what we already possess. Thracian Chalcis has been in a state of revolt for years now and remains intractable to this day, while the loyalty of other mainland cities is also questionable. We, meanwhile, are suddenly so eager to help the Segesteans on the grounds that they are allies who have been wronged, even as we refuse to confront those who have long been wronging us. 

\[11\] We could be sure of retaining all of our territory if we made an effort to crush those in-surgencies. By contrast, even if we managed to defeat the Sicilians it would be difficult to rule them, for theirs is a distant and populous land.

It will be senseless to conquer them if we cannot control them afterwards and a failed attempt would leave us in a much worse position than before. As things stand, I think the Sicilians would pres ent even less of a challenge if they were all under Syracuse’s sway, despite the Segesteans’ efforts to frighten us with that prospect. Right now, certain Sicilians might be inclined to sail here to help the Spartans, but if they were governed by Syracuse it seems unlikely that the one empire would want to attack the other. After all, if they were to join the Peloponnesians in dismantling our empire, sooner or later the Peloponnesians would most likely do the same to them for that very reason. 

What would most shock the Sicilian Greeks would be for us not to go there at all; what would shock them most after that would be for us to go, make a quick show of our strength, and then leave. We all know that people tend to 217

That, Athenians, is precisely what we have experienced in our dealings with Sparta and its allies. Though you were initially apprehensive, your victories against them came so easily that your fear has turned to scorn and now you set your sights on Sicily. We should not be so buoyed by our enemies’ failures but must keep that kind of confidence at bay until they have truly reconciled themselves to defeat. Because of their recent embarrassments, the Spartans now think of nothing except how they might still—if indeed they can— get the better of us and reverse their humiliation, for their culture has always put an absolute premium on military glory.5 All of this means that, if we have any sense, we will realize that the conflict actually 219

Vote to let the Sicilians manage matters within the borders \(perfectly acceptable ones\) that divide their territory from ours: the Ionian Sea if the voyage is along the coast and the Sicilian Sea if the journey is over open water. Make your decision to leave them to handle their own affairs and resolve things on their own, and tell the Segesteans the same: that they began their war against the Selinuntines with no help from Athens and it is now up to them to settle it.

\[16\] Athenians, I am the best man to lead this expedition \(I have to begin there, in light of Nicias’ attacks\) and I also think I deserve to. 

Every thing that I am being vilified for is, in real ity, a credit to both my ancestors and me and an asset to this country. The other Greeks had assumed that our city was debilitated by war, but when they saw my splendid showing at Olympia they drew the conclusion that Athens is stronger than it actually is. That is because I entered seven chariots in the races— more than any private citizen in history. I won and also placed second and fourth, and made every effort to put on a display worthy of my victory. 

Honor is typically the prize in these sorts of contests but the accomplishment is also suggestive of power. Likewise, whenever I distinguish 231

myself in Athens by paying for choruses or the like, the people are naturally jealous— but the city appears mighty in foreigners’ eyes. It is hardly a senseless waste when a man’s private outlay serves not just his own interests but his city’s as well. There is, moreover, nothing wrong with elites demanding special treatment; after all, less fortunate people avoid imposing their trou bles on others. We hardly expect to be showered with attention when we are down on our luck, so by the same logic why should it bother people if their superiors disdain them? You can only demand equal re spect if you give it. 

I realize that men like this, men who out-shine others with a special brilliance, irritate other people— their peers most of all, but really anyone they interact with— during their own lifetimes. Yet they also bequeath subsequent generations with an urge to claim them as 233

Their fatherlands eventually boast of them and no longer paint them as foreign and villainous but as native sons who accomplished remarkable things. I very much hope that this will happen for me, seeing as it is why I am so publicly denounced for my private life. What you really need to consider is whether there is anyone better than I am at handling public affairs. After all, I was the one who formed the co ali tion of the most power ful cities of the Peloponnese at no great risk or expense to yourselves. I was the one who drove the Spartans to stake every thing they had on a single day in Mantinea. They might have won the battle, but even today they lack the bold confidence they had before.

the entire Peloponnesian force and my passion persuaded them to trust me. Do not, then, be frightened by my youth. As long as I remain at its peak and Nicias is still successful, you should be harnessing these qualities to the best of your advantage. Do not, moreover, change your minds about sailing to Sicily because of the size of the force there. These are cities that teem with diverse populations; whose citizen bodies undergo constant changes and new additions. 

Nobody, then, feels like they are fighting for their own fatherland. The soldiers, moreover, lack adequate armor and the territory lacks regular defenses. Every body there thinks that they can acquire more land simply by giving a good speech or by setting themselves at odds with the community and when their plans fail they are always prepared to up and move somewhere else.

It is highly unlikely that this mass of people will have the same reaction to any speech they hear or be able to pull off a coordinated effort. 

Each man is for himself over there and they are all just as quick to ally with anyone who gives an appealing speech as they are to quarrel, especially if there is the internal strife that we believe there to be. As to actual hoplites, their boasts far exceed the real ity— just like the other Greek states, which time and again have exag-gerated the number of their troops. In fact, on this point Greece has proven im mensely dis-ingenuous, seeing as it has barely been able to muster adequate numbers for the pres ent war. 

This, then, is, from what I hear, how things stand over there. What is more, if you consider how many non- Greeks will join our assault simply out of hatred for Syracuse, circumstances are prob ably even more favorable than I have made them out to be. On the other hand, there is 239

Our fathers had to deal with the very same enemies that these people claim we will leave behind if we sail, and had the Persians to reckon with on top of that. Yet they managed to build this empire when they were nothing but a naval power. The Peloponnesians’ strug gle against us has never been as hopeless as it is now, but if they do recover their strength they could invade us by land regardless of whether we make this expedition. 

And if we do make it, they will still be powerless to harm our navy because what ever fraction of it we leave behind will still be a match for theirs. 

\[18\] What reason, then, could we possibly give for our own hesitation, or for having second thoughts about aiding our allies? We have to help them because we swore that we would, and it is no excuse for us to say that they have never 241

done anything to earn it. We did not join forces with them so that they would thank us by help-ing us here; we made this alliance so that they would make trou ble for our enemies over there and keep them from attacking us at home. We built an empire the same way that every one else has, by gladly lending our support to anyone, Greek or other wise, who asked for it. So, if we sit idly by, or split hairs over matters of ethnic-ity in deciding whom to help, it will be a long time before we ever manage to expand our rule. It seems we would rather risk losing it all instead. 

Defending yourself is not simply a matter of reacting to attacks already underway; it also means anticipating future attacks and prevent-ing them from happening. We do not simply get to make a calculation as to how large we wish our empire to be. We have to face real ity and take it upon ourselves to maneuver in certain 243

Considering that the best bet for improving things here is for us to go there, let us make the expedition, if only so that the Peloponnesians become demoralized when they see that we resented the current tranquility so much that we deci ded to sail against Sicily. In all probability, with the gains that we make there we will become rulers over the whole of Greece, or at the very least do serious damage to Syracuse, which will be good both for us and for our allies. 

After the invasion, our ships will protect us regardless of whether things work out and we stay or else decide to leave. And no matter what happens, we will be masters of the Sicilian seas.

Do not, then, be dissuaded by Nicias’ proposal of non- intervention or by the wedge that he is trying to drive between young and old. 

Try instead to carry the city forward in the usual manner and conduct yourselves like our fathers, who accomplished so much because, as young men, they deliberated these kinds of matters with their elders. Keep in mind that youth and old age are nothing without each other and that the greatest strength lies in a balance of modest, middling, and elite. Think too that the city, like anything else, will naturally deteriorate if it is not put to good use and that all of the knowledge it has acquired over the years will quickly become obsolete. If it constantly strug gles to add to its experience, however, it will develop a habit of defending itself not just with words but with actions. My point is that I know that a city unused to inaction begins to fall apart the moment it becomes 247

my opinion in light of the pres ent situation. We are about to attack cities which are very large \(or so I hear\) and which are neither subject to one another nor desirous of constitutional change: we are not talking about people longing to escape forced enslavement in exchange for a less oppressive regime. Nor is it likely that our empire will be received as a welcome replace-ment for freedom. There are, moreover, many Greek cities on that one single island. Apart from Naxos and Catania, which I hope will join us because of their ethnic ties to the Leontin-eans, seven other cities are all equipped with forces equivalent to our own. This is particularly true of the ones that we plan to attack most aggressively, Selinunte and Syracuse. They have plenty of hoplites, archers, and spearmen; a great deal of triremes; and population enough to man the ships. They also have plenty of private wealth, while the Selinuntines’ temples are 251

rich and the Syracusans collect tribute from vari-ous barbarian peoples. And then there are the points on which they enjoy the advantage: they have a ready supply of horses and do not import grain because they grow enough of it there. 

\[21\] Against those kinds of odds a fleet and small army will not suffice. We need a full complement of infantry if we wish to follow through on our goals and avoid being blocked on the ground by their horse men, particularly if fear drives these cities to band together and we are left to resist the cavalry with no allies but the Segesteans. It would be an embarrassment if we were forced to retreat and launch the attack again simply because we had been careless in our initial planning. Right from the start, then, we need to assem ble a force that is equal to this fight and be cognizant of the fact that we are about to sail very far from our own country.

This expedition will bear little resemblance to those we have launched in the past against subject states closer to home, when we could rely on friendly allies in the neighborhood for ready provisions. We are about to cut ourselves off in a wholly foreign land, one so distant that in wintertime it can take more than four months for a messenger just to get here from there. 

\[22\] I therefore think that we need to go in with a great many hoplites, supplied from both our own populations and our allies, as well as men from subject states and anyone we can either persuade or pay to come from the Peloponnese. We also need enough archers and slingers to fend off their cavalry and plenty of ships so that we can convey supplies easily. We will have to bring our own grain, wheat and roasted barley, on supply ships, and distribute paid bakers conscripted from the mills so that, 255

ON LAUNCHING AN INVASION

even if our ships are unable to sail, the army will still have enough provisions, for not every local city will be able to host so large a force. We must also take all other necessary steps to ensure that we can be self- sufficient. It will be especially impor tant to take as much money with us as pos si ble; as for all the money allegedly available in Segesta, be sure to put the emphasis on precisely that word: “allegedly.” 

\[23\] Even if we set out from here all on our own, though we may manage to muster a force not merely equal to theirs \(except in terms of their actual soldiers, the hoplites, with which we cannot compete\) but superior in every way, it will still be no easy task to defeat them and return home safely. We have to treat this as if we were headed off to establish a colony in a foreign and enemy land and when that is the case you have either to conquer the territory on 257

ON LAUNCHING AN INVASION

γὰρ τῇ τε ξυμπάσῃ πόλει βεβαιότατα ἡγοῦμαι 

καὶ ἡμῖν τοῖς στρατευσομένοις σωτήρια. εἰ δέ τῳ 

ἄλλως δοκεῖ, παρίημι αὐτῷ τὴν ἀρχήν. 

\[24\] Ὁ μὲν Νικίας τοσαῦτα εἶπε, νομίζων 

τοὺς Ἀθηναίους τῷ πλήθει τῶν πραγμάτων ἢ 

ἀποτρέψειν ἤ, εἰ ἀναγκάζοιτο στρατεύεσθαι, μάλιστ’ ἂν οὕτως ἀσϕαλῶς ἐκπλεῦσαι. οἱ δὲ τὸ

ὀχλώδους τῆς παρασκευῆς, πολὺ δὲ μᾶλλον 

258

ON LAUNCHING AN INVASION

the very first day or, failing that, come to grips with the fact that hostility will exist on all sides. 

With that apprehension in mind, and in the knowledge that we are dependent on good counsel and even more so on good luck \(of which we mere mortals have no guarantee\), I have no desire to sail off with my fate entrusted to chance but would rather embark in relative safety with a force as fit for the task as pos si ble. I think that this is the surest course of action for the city in general and it will mean our salvation if we do launch this invasion. If anyone has a dif ferent opinion, I relinquish my command to him. 

\[24\] *That, more or less, was what Nicias said,* *in the hopes that either the Athenians would be* *dissuaded by the magnitude of the force required* *or, if he should still be made to undertake the* *mission, this counsel would ensure his safety. *

*Nevertheless, the Athenians lost none of their* 259

ON LAUNCHING AN INVASION

ὥρμηντο καὶ τοὐναντίον περιέστη αὐτῷ· εὖ τε 

γὰρ παραινέσαι ἔδοξε καὶ ἀσϕάλεια νῦν δὴ καὶ 

πολλὴ ἔσεσθαι. καὶ ἔρως ἐνέπεσε τοῖς πᾶσιν 

ὁμοίως ἐκπλεῦσαι, τοῖς μὲν γὰρ πρεσβυτέροις ὡς 

ἢ καταστρεψομένοις ἐϕ᾽ ἃ ἔπλεον ἢ οὐδὲν ἂν

εὐέλπιδες ὄντες σωθήσεσθαι, ὁ δὲ πολὺς ὅμιλος 

καὶ στρατιώτης ἔν τε τῷ παρόντι ἀργύριον 

οἴσειν καὶ προσκτήσεσθαι δύναμιν ὅθεν ἀίδιον 

μισθοϕορὰν ὑπάρξειν. ὥστε διὰ τὴν ἄγαν τῶν 

πλειόνων ἐπιθυμίαν, εἴ τῳ ἄρα καὶ μὴ ἤρεσκε, δεδιὼς μὴ ἀντιχειροτονῶν κακόνους δόξειεν εἶναι

*initial enthusiasm, even when they heard what* *massive preparations would be required. To the* *contrary, they grew all the more excited at the* *prospect and, in the end, did just the opposite of* *what Nicias had advised. In fact, they thought* *his admonitions superb and that the complete* *safety of the enterprise was now assured. A longing to set sail washed over them one and all: the* *older generation believed they would devastate* *any territory they invaded, or at least that no* *harm could ever come to so great a force, while* *the younger men yearned to leave home to see* *distant lands and were optimistic about their* *own safety. As for the ordinary soldier, he saw a* *promise of immediate pay and a prospect of per-manent income. The result of the extreme and* *excessive enthusiasm was that even those who* *disapproved of the expedition kept quiet out of* *fear that a vote against the plan would be taken* *as proof of their hostility toward the city. *

The Speeches

For my translations I used the Oxford Classical Text edition. The Greek texts provided here are from the Loeb editions. 

1 Sparta did send ambassadors back to negotiate in 425, but the Athenians would again refuse to make peace \(4.17–20\). 

2 In this speech of Pericles, I have rendered *politeia* as “institutions” at §36 and as “system of government” at §37. 

3 In the 420s, the Spartan general Brasidas had led successful campaigns against certain Athenian allies in Thrace, but left others untouched. 

4 At 111.1 I accept Classen’s addition of ἡμῖν after γένοιτο. 

5 A reference to Sparta’s uncharacteristic and shocking surrender to Athens a de cade earlier at 267

NOTES

the 425 battles of Pylos and Sphacteria \(4.3–40; see also the introduction to On Ruthlessness: The Melian Dialogue\). Thucydides writes of the surrender that “in the whole course of the war, nothing astonished the Greeks so much as this” 

\(4.40\).
