# INTRODUCTION



## The Life of Aristotle

Aristotle was born in the mountainous land of Macedonia in northern Greece in the year 384 BCE. His father, Nicomachus, was the personal physician to the Macedonian king Amyntas II, grandfather of Alexander the Great. At seventeen, after the death of his parents, Aristotle left his home and journeyed south to Athens to study at the Academy of Plato, the greatest center of learning in the ancient world. Although he respectfully disagreed with some of the teachings of his famous instructor, he remained at the Academy for many years, until Plato’s death in 347.

Plato, himself a student of Socrates, was a master of theory, as was his brilliant pupil Aristotle, but the younger man was also a passionate student of experimental and practical research. When Aristotle left Athens, he moved to Assos in northwestern Asia Minor, then to the nearby island of Lesbos to study marine biology. In 342, he returned to his homeland of Macedonia at the invitation of King Philip to become the tutor of his teenage son Alexander for several years before the prince left to begin his military training and ultimate conquest of much of the known world. Aristotle then traveled to Athens to found his own school and research center, known as the Lyceum, where he and his students studied every facet of human society and the natural world from art to zoology. Only with the death of Alexander in Babylon and the violent resurgence of anti-Macedonian feelings did Aristotle flee Athens in 323, claiming he would not let the Athenians sin against philosophy a second time as they had in killing Socrates. He died of natural causes in his early sixties the following year on the Aegean island of Euboea.

## Aristotle’s Writings

The breadth of Aristotle’s inquiries and published works is astonishing. Although only about thirty of his two hundred books and treatises have survived the centuries, it is no exaggeration to say that most of the subjects and disciplines studied today at universities around the world were deeply influenced if not founded by Aristotle. His works on logic, physics, biology, meteorology, ethics, political science, and the arts were fundamental texts in the European and Islamic world for centuries and remain a touchstone for scholars and students today. Only Plato has come close to leaving the same impact on philosophy and scholarship.

However, unlike the dialogues of Plato, Aristotle’s surviving books are not polished works that delight readers with their literary as well as intellectual charm. The corpus of Aristotle’s writings are preserved only as outlines and lecture notes of varying levels of readability. Whether they were prepared by Aristotle himself or, as some scholars think, by his students, they can be a challenge to read.

But even with their difficulties, the writings of Aristotle are among the most profound and insightful works of human history. Few other thinkers have been able to observe and analyze the various aspects and problems of human culture and the natural world with such clarity of vision, even if he is at times mistaken \(e.g., oysters do not spontaneously generate\). Though we should never accept Aristotle as correct in everything he wrote as some did in medieval times, nonetheless his foundational theories and thoughts on many timeless subjects, from the best form of government to the true meaning of friendship, are as important today as they were in the gardens of the Lyceum over twenty-three centuries ago.

## The *Poetics* of Aristotle

Of the many disciplines Aristotle developed, the study of literature as found in his *Poetics* is among the most engaging.

In spite of the title, the *Poetics* is about far more than poetry, at least in the modern sense of the word. In ancient Greece, almost all literature was written in poetic verse, from epic tales of heroes past to obscene comedies. Although Aristotle focuses primarily on tragedies such as Sophocles’s *Oedipus Rex* presented on the Athenian stage, his insights into storytelling are applicable to all kinds of modern literature, drama, and film.

But the *Poetics* suffers from being even less polished than most of Aristotle’s writings. It is full of logical gaps, missing pieces, and outright contradictions, not to mention a somewhat tedious section on linguistics and the loss of its entire second half, on the topic of comedy. We shouldn’t fault Aristotle for this but take the *Poetics* as we have it, as an inspired piece of work full of brilliant insights that was never meant to be published in its present form. If we do this, then we can begin to learn the many lessons the *Poetics* has to teach. A few of these:

*All storytelling is a kind of imitation*—Just as painters represent and interpret the world around them, writers tell of people, places, and things from real life in their stories. Even the most imaginative stories reflect the world as we know it; otherwise no one would be able to relate to them.

*Every story has an appropriate length*—Even with a lengthy epic, the readers or viewers must be able to keep the whole of the story in their mind’s eye; otherwise they will become lost and lose interest. As Aristotle says, an animal too small to be seen or too gigantic to view at once is of little interest to us.

*Stories must have a beginning, middle, and end*—Although this may seem obvious, many stories fail terribly at being whole and complete. They often start strong but lose their way and end weakly or with an unbelievable event to bring the story clumsily to a close. A strong story, as Aristotle says, builds on itself, is consistent, and never loses its path.

*Spectacle is secondary to story line*—In a story presented on stage or screen, costumes, set design, and elaborate pageantry are all subordinate to the story itself. Audiences will not be impressed by even the most spectacular special effects without a strong story underlying them.

*Plot is more important than characters*—Although some writers and readers will disagree, Aristotle believes that the story itself comes before even the most interesting characters who inhabit it. Strong and well-developed characters are crucial, but the plot comes first.

*The best conflict occurs between family and friends*—Hostility and fights between strangers can be interesting, but for the most powerful and moving stories, make the conflict between people who love each other.

*The most satisfying tragic stories are about good people who make mistakes*—An evil character coming to a bad end is as predictable as a perfect character for whom everything turns out well in the finale. If you want to move your audience, make your starring role a basically decent person with a terrible weakness that ruins his or her life by the end of the story. Since we are all imperfect, we can identify with such people. Watching their downfall brings about pity for them and fear that such a thing could happen to us.

But this is just the beginning. Aristotle has many more insights into storytelling in the *Poetics* that readers—and writers—will discover for themselves. Aristotle’s work is a living guidebook for modern authors. As Aaron Sorkin, the Academy Award–winning screenwriter behind *The Social Network* and *The West Wing* says: “Rules are what makes art beautiful.… These rules also apply to writing. The rulebook is the *Poetics* by Aristotle. All the rules are there.”\*

# A NOTE ON THE TRANSLATION



The Greek text of the *Poetics* as Aristotle wrote it consists of unpolished lecture notes, not a finished literary work like the dialogues of his teacher Plato. The text also has missing words and sentences, with other parts annotated, rearranged, and in general jumbled by copyists over the centuries more than most manuscripts from the ancient world. The result is a book that will leave even the best classical scholars at times scratching their heads in confusion.

I have therefore done everything I reasonably could to make Aristotle’s words clear while maintaining faithfulness to the Greek. The original *Poetics* does not have chapter headings, numbering, or bullet points, all of which I have added to guide readers through the sometimes confusing threads of his arguments. For clarity and ease of reading, I have also at times expanded the text by including definitions of words in the translation itself or using more than one English term for a Greek word to better render the richness of the original.

My hope in this new translation has been to create a version of the *Poetics* that is as accurate as possible, but also one that modern readers and writers can more easily understand and use to create their own stories or better appreciate those from any age.



 





# HOW TO TELL A STORY

 





## Introduction: Storytelling Is Imitation

1. In this book we are going to discuss the craft of poetry1—that is, of storytelling—of all kinds, along with the power each kind of poetry can have. We will also examine how to put together plots of high quality, the number and nature of the parts that make up a story, and other topics of this sort.

Let us begin, as is natural, with basic principles.

Epic2 and tragic poetry,3 as well as comedy, dithyrambic poetry,4 and most music played on the pipes and lyre—these are all a kind of *imitation*.5

But these arts differ from one another in their imitation in three ways—namely, they use different media, different objects, or different manners.

## Media—How Do You Tell Your Story?

Some people, either by artistic training or by natural ability, use colors and shapes to imitate various things, while others imitate with their voices.

In the same way the poetic arts I have mentioned produce imitations by means of rhythm, language, and melody, whether using them separately or in combinations. For example, music for the pipes or lyre or similar instruments like panpipes6 uses only melody and rhythm.

The art of dancing uses rhythm alone, without melody, but its rhythmic movements also imitate character, emotion, and action.

The craft that uses only words for imitation—either in prose or in verse, whether using a single meter or a mixture of meters—has no name even today.7 We have no common term for the mimes of Sophron and Xenarchus and the Socratic dialogues, nor for imitation that one might make using iambic trimeters, elegiac couplets, or other kinds of meters.8

Of course people attach the term *poetry* to different types of meter and so call some writers *elegiac poets* or *epic poets*, but they call them all a certain type of poet because they use the same poetic meter, not because they are similar in the nature of their imitation. Even if someone writes about medicine or physics in verse, they are still called poets. But Homer and Empedocles9 have nothing in common except that they both use the same type of poetic meter. We should certainly call Homer a poet, but Empedocles is clearly a scientist. And if someone mixes many different meters, not just a single form, like Chaeremon10 did in his metric medley *Centaur*, we should include him among the poets too. We should pay attention to distinctions like this.

There are also some types of poetic works, such as dithyramb, nome,11 tragedy, and comedy, that use all the different media mentioned above—rhythm, melody, and meter. They differ in that some use them all together while others use them at different times.

This then is what I mean by the differences between the arts and how they use different media to create imitation.

## Objects—What Are Your Characters Like?

2. Everyone who uses imitation in their art represents people engaged in actions.

The people represented must be either good or bad in their character. Almost everyone is marked by either a good or a bad character, since it is by virtue or vice that the character of a person is known.

People imitated by artists can be better than us, worse than us, or much the same as us.

Painters illustrate this in their subjects. Polygnotus depicted superior people, Pauson the inferior sort, while Dionysius painted ordinary people.12

It is clear that each of the different kinds of artistic imitation we mentioned earlier follows this same pattern—better, worse, or the same as us—and they are distinguished from each other in how they represent their objects in different ways.

These differences are also seen in dance, along with music for the pipe and lyre. This also holds true for prose and for verse not accompanied by music. Homer, for example, imitates superior people, while Cleophon’s characters are similar to us.13 On the other hand, Hegemon of Thasos, who invented parody, and Nicochares, author of the *Deiliad*, imitated inferior people.14

The same is true of dithyrambs and nomes, for a writer could imitate Cyclopes as did Timotheus and Philoxenus.15

But most importantly, tragedy and comedy differ from each other in the same way. Tragedy imitates a better sort of person than us. Comedy imitates people worse than we are.

## Manner—Who Is Telling Your Story?

3. A third way in which the arts differ from one another in imitation is manner or mode. In the same type of media you can imitate the same objects in different ways. In telling a story, you can use multiple narrators with different personalities, as Homer does,16 or single-person narration. You can also have the characters performing actions directly.

## Differences and Overlap in Storytelling

So these then are the three differences in types of artistic imitation, as we said at the beginning: media \(how the story is told\), object \(characters\), and manner \(narration\).

In one respect Sophocles is the same type of imitator as Homer, since both portray superior characters. On the other hand, Sophocles is like the comic writer Aristophanes17 since both of them present their characters performing actions directly. This is where some say *drama* gets its name, since it represents people in action.18

## A Brief Dorian Digression

Because of this, the Dorians19 claim to have invented both tragedy and comedy. The Megarians specifically say they invented comedy, both those from Megara on the mainland \(who say it was invented during their democracy\)20 and those Megarian colonists in Sicily \(because it was the birthplace of Epicharmus, who lived long before Chionides and Magnes\).21 Certain Peloponnesians claim they themselves invented tragedy.22

The Dorians say the words they use prove they were the inventors of both tragedy and comedy, since they call their country villages *kômai* while the Athenians call theirs *dêmoi*. From this the Dorians claim that comic performers didn’t get their name *kômôdoi* from the word *kômazein* \(to revel, make merry\), but from the villages they wandered through after they were expelled from the cities. They furthermore say the Dorian word for acting or doing is *dran*, not *prattein* as it is among the Athenians.

So much then for the discussion of the number and nature of the distinctions in imitation.

## Where Does Storytelling Come From?

4. In general, it seems that there are two causes for the beginnings of poetry, both of them arising from human nature.

*Imitation*—First, imitation comes naturally to people from childhood. Indeed this is one thing that distinguishes us from other animals, since we have a powerful and natural inclination to imitating. This is how we learn our earliest lessons in life.

We all take great pleasure in imitation. The experience of our lives is proof enough of this since we naturally delight in seeing the most accurate imitations possible even when they cause us distress, such as representations of vile creatures or corpses. The reason for this is that we all enjoy understanding things—especially philosophers, but others too even though they aren’t able to do it as well.23

This is why people enjoy viewing images, because when we see them we began to understand and work out what each image represents—“Oh, this is a picture of so-and-so\!” But if it isn’t something or someone you’ve seen before, it won’t give you pleasure as an imitation, though you can still appreciate the skill in creating it or its color or for some similar reason.

*Rhythm*—The second cause for the beginnings of poetry is that melody and rhythm are also natural to us—and poetic meter is certainly a type of rhythm. From the start those who had a special talent for these things created poetry gradually through improvisation.

## The Early History of Greek Poetry

Poetry developed into two genres according to the character of those who composed it.

Serious authors imitated in their works serious people and their noble actions. Less serious authors composed stories about common and less admirable people, creating satires in verse. The serious authors however composed hymns and poems of praise.

We don’t know of any satiric works before Homer, though there were probably many, but we can begin with his *Margites* and other stories of the same kind.24 The iambic verse form developed because it worked very well in these types of poems. Such poems are called *iambic* now because in those days poets used this meter to satirize each other.25

And so some ancient poets wrote heroic epics while others wrote satires. Homer was certainly the greatest of the serious poets since he not only wrote very well but also was able to dramatize his imitations. In addition, he was the first author to define the forms of comedy by adding drama to what we laugh about, though he didn’t engage in personal satire. His *Margites* bears the same relation to comedy as the *Iliad* and *Odyssey* do to tragedy.

## The History of Tragedy

When tragedy and comedy first appeared, many poets were led by their own nature to produce one or the other. Some turned to composing comic plays instead of long lampoons, while others produced tragic dramas instead of lengthy epic poems. These new, shorter forms of storytelling were seen as more important and esteemed than the earlier types.

This isn’t the place to examine whether or not tragedy is sufficiently developed in its various parts or whether we should judge it just in relation to itself or how it relates to audiences in theatrical performances. All of that is a separate matter.

In a sense, tragedy first arose accidentally, as did comedy. Tragedy came about from the leaders of a dithyrambic chorus, comedy from the leaders of groups singing phallic songs, as they still do in some cities.26

Tragedy gradually evolved as writers developed new aspects and potential in its performance. After these changes were introduced, it eventually became fixed in how it was presented onstage since it had achieved its true nature.

Aeschylus was the first playwright to increase the number of speaking actors from one to two, making the actors the focus of the drama and reducing the importance of the chorus.27 Sophocles then introduced a third actor and painted scenery.28 It was only at a later stage that tragedy developed longer plots and more dignified diction as it evolved away from its roots in satyr plays, along with a shift in meter from trochaic tetrameter to iambic trimeter.29 They used trochaic tetrameter at first because it better fit the style of a satyr play and was more like the rhythm of a dance. But when actors began to step out from the chorus and speak, the writers found that it was natural to switch to iambic trimeters because they are closer to the way we normally speak. We often use trimeters in everyday conversation, but not other meters such as hexameters,30 except when we’re departing from our normal style of speech.

As for the number of episodes31 in tragedy and other such features, we will pass over these as it would take too long to give a full history of each development.

## The History of Comedy

5. Comedy, as we have said, is an imitation of inferior people.

Comic characters are not cruel or vicious, but laughable—laughability being one category of what is shameful or disgraceful. Being laughable is a shortcoming or disgrace that doesn’t involve any serious pain or destruction. For example, a comic mask is ugly and twisted, but it isn’t painful to look at.32

The history of tragedy and the people responsible for these changes are known well enough, but we have no record of the origins and development of comedy since no one paid much attention to it. It was only later that the archon even granted a chorus at public expense to comic writers.33 Before that the chorus of a comedy was all volunteers.

It’s only after comedy had already developed some of its characteristic features that the names of the earliest comic writers are known. We don’t know who first introduced comic masks, prologues, multiple actors, and other such things, but we do know that comic plots originated in Sicily and that the Athenian poet Crates was the first to abandon crude lampoons of individuals to give comedies plots and stories with a more universal appeal.34

## How Is Epic Different from Tragedy?

Epic is like tragedy in the sense that it is an imitation in poetic meter of noble people \(unlike comedy\). But epic is different because it uses a single meter and is narrated.35

Epic and tragedy also differ in length, with tragedy when possible having its action take place within a single day or perhaps a little longer. But epic is not bound within a certain time period, though the earliest tragedies were unrestricted in time like epic.

Some parts of tragedy are common with epic; others are used only in tragedy. Whoever knows what makes a tragedy good or bad knows the same about epic, since the basic qualities of epic are common with tragedy. But not all the qualities of tragedy are shared with epic.

## The Crucial Elements of Tragedy

6. I will discuss imitation in epic and comedy later. For now, let’s take up where we left off and examine what tragedy is, based on what we’ve already said:

+ Tragedy is an imitation of an action that is elevated, complete, and of sufficient length. 
+ Each part of a tragic drama uses language that is embellished. 
+ Tragedy is acted, not narrated. 
+ Tragedy evokes *pity* and *fear*. By doing do it brings about a *catharsis* or purging of emotions.36 

When I say the language of tragedy is embellished, I mean that it uses melody and rhythm. Some parts of the play are performed by speech in a metrical rhythm, while other parts are done through song.

## The Parts of Tragedy

+ *Spectacle*: Since tragedy is an imitation performed by actors, it follows that a part of telling the story is arranging and managing what the audience sees on the stage. 
+ *Music and speech*: Add to this music and speech, for these are the media through which the actors perform the imitation. By speech I mean the diction or composition of metrical speech in the play. Hopefully everyone already knows what music is. 
+ *Character, plot, and reasoning*: Since tragedy is an imitation of action performed by certain agents, the agents should have qualities in respect to character and reasoning, for the character and reasoning of a person are what define his or her actions and thus success or failure. Plot is the imitation of action—and by plot I mean how the events and incidents in the tragedy are organized. Character is what makes an agent behave in a certain way. Reasoning is what actors say in a tragedy to argue a case or put forward their views. 

And so tragedy has six parts that determine its quality: plot, character, speech, reasoning, spectacle, and music. The six all fall under our previous categories of media \(speech, music\), manner \(spectacle\), or object \(plot, character, reasoning\).

## Plot Is the Most Important Thing

These elements are used by practically every writer of tragedy, for almost every drama has spectacle, character, plot, speech, music, and reasoning.

The most important element in any tragedy is plot.

Tragedy is not an imitation of persons but of actions and life, because happiness and misfortune are found in action. The goal of tragic drama \(and indeed life\) is a proper kind of activity, not some quality. People possess certain qualities based on their nature, but they find happiness or unhappiness depending on what they actually do.

Therefore the goal of an actor on the stage is not to imitate character. Character is instead a by-product of action. Actions and plot are what a tragedy is about. That is what matters.

You cannot have a tragedy without action, but you could without character. The tragedies of most modern poets lack character—and there are quite a few of them. I’m speaking of the sort of difference we have in painters between Zeuxis and Polygnotus, for Polygnotus is very good at expressing character but the paintings of Zeuxis have none.37

Also, you could write a series of beautiful and well-reasoned speeches in a play in which character was expressed only in words, with no actions, but it still wouldn’t fulfill the essential functions of a tragedy. It would be better and more effective to have a play in which such speeches are absent but that nonetheless has plot and narrative structure.

Besides, the most important means by which a tragedy stirs our emotions—reversals and recognitions—is in the actions of its plot.

A final argument for the supremacy of plot is that beginning writers can often achieve excellence in speech and characterization before they can master the structure of a story. Almost all our earliest tragic writers share this deficiency as well.

And so plot is the first principle and, so to speak, the soul of tragedy. Character comes second. Painting is much the same way. If an artist were to cover a surface with the finest and most beautiful colors at random, it would provide the viewer with less pleasure than a simple outline of an object.

In summary, tragedy is the imitation of action—and it is for the sake of the action that characters play their parts.

## The Other Elements of Tragedy

Reason is the third element of tragedy. It is the ability to say what is apt and appropriate in a situation, which in prose writings is the function of politics and rhetoric. Earlier writers of tragedy used to make their characters speak like politicians, but contemporary dramatists have them speak rhetorically. Character is revealed in the choices a person makes, so that speeches in a play in which the speaker doesn’t choose or make a clear choice do not express character. Reasoning becomes clear in a drama when actors argue that something is or isn’t true, or when they give a general opinion.

The fourth element of tragedy is speech. By this I mean, as I said before, the use of words to express meaning. This is true in both poetry and prose.

Of the remaining elements of tragedy, music is the most important of those that give pleasure. As for spectacle \(how things appear onstage\), it can certainly evoke emotion, but it isn’t really much of an art and has very little to do with poetry. The power of a tragedy, after all, isn’t essentially dependent on actors and performance.38 And such things as visual effects really belong to the craft of producers rather than poets.39

## Every Story Must Have a Beginning, Middle, and End

7. Now that we have the definitions of the elements of tragic drama, we should turn to what the plot or structure of a story should be, since this is the first and most important part of tragedy.

We have established that a tragedy is an imitation of an action that is whole and complete, but also of a certain length, for a story can be complete without being very long.

A story that is complete must have a beginning, middle, and ending.

A *beginning* doesn’t necessarily follow from anything before, but other events naturally follow it and proceed from it. And *ending*, on the other hand, naturally or in general follows from something else that comes before it, but has nothing that comes after it. A *middle* follows from some other event and also has things that occur after it.

A well-constructed plot must therefore not begin or end at some arbitrary point but follow this pattern.

## The Length of a Story

Any beautiful object, whether an animal or anything else that has parts, must not only possess those parts in a proper order but also have an appropriate size or magnitude. Beauty must have size as well as order. Because of this no animal can be beautiful if it is too small, since we would pass over it quickly, unable to observe it, or enormously large—say a thousand miles long—since we would not be able to observe and take in the whole thing all at once.

Just as physical objects and living organisms should possess an appropriate size and be able to be comprehended in a coherent way, so too with plots. They should be of a certain length so that they can be remembered.

The time limits imposed by the circumstances of a particular theatrical performance or by the attention span of the audience are not really a concern of the art of writing. After all, if it were necessary to perform a hundred tragedies at a festival they would time the performances by water clocks, as they say used to be done.40

What should matter to the writer is the limit set by the nature of the action in the story and thus the principle that a longer plot is usually better and more beautiful, provided that it can still be held in the memory all at once.

A simple definition of the proper length of a story would be that it is long enough to allow a change from good fortune to bad or bad fortune to good, in accord with what is probable or necessary.

## The Unity of a Plot

8. In spite of what some people think, a plot is not unified because it is about a single person. Many things—indeed an infinite number of things—happen to the same individual, but not all of these form a unity. Likewise a single person performs many actions, but they do not form a unified action.

All those poets who composed a *Heracleid* about Hercules or a *Theseid* about Theseus were wrong in thinking that because they wrote about a single person that they created a unified plot.41 But Homer, outstanding as he was in other respects, understood the principle of unity as well, whether by conscious learning or by instinct. He didn’t include in the *Odyssey* everything that happened in the life of Odysseus—such as his wounding on Mount Parnassus or his pretending to be mad when the troops were being called up for the Trojan War—because there was no necessity or probability connecting these events.42 Instead Homer constructed the *Odyssey* about a single central action of the sort we’re discussing, just as he did the *Iliad*.

Therefore, just as in other imitative arts in which the imitation must have a single object, so too the plot of a story—being the imitation of an action—should have a single, unified, complete action. A plot should be structured so that if any of its episodes were rearranged or removed, the whole story would be disturbed and dislocated. If this isn’t the case, then that episode is not an essential part of the whole.

## The Best Stories Are about What Could Happen

9. It’s clear from what we’ve said that the role of a poet is not to say what *has* happened but what *could* happen, within the bounds of probability or necessity. The difference between a historian and a poet is not that one uses prose and the other verse. After all, you could take the *History* of Herodotus43 and turn it into verse, but it would still be history, not poetry. The historian tells us what *has* happened, the poet what *could* happen.

This is why poetry is more like philosophy and is more important than history. Poetry is about *universals*, while history is about *particulars*. A universal is what people would probably or necessarily say or do in a certain situation. Poetry does this even when it attaches a real name to a character, but history deals strictly with the actions or experiences of a particular person, like Alcibiades.44

This is obvious in comedy as well. A comic writer first constructs a plot on the basis of probabilities, then makes up names for the characters. Comic poets don’t write about real people like lampoonists or satirists do.

Writers of tragedy do use the names of actual people.45 The reason for this is that to most people what is possible \(i.e., what has happened in the past\) is plausible, but they aren’t sure if something is possible if it hasn’t occurred. But it’s obvious that something that has happened is possible—otherwise it wouldn’t have happened.

But even in tragedies there are sometimes only one or two names that are familiar, as in Agathon’s *Antheus*.46 In this play both the events and the characters are made up, but it’s still very pleasant to watch. Writers shouldn’t try to stick to traditional stories at all costs. Indeed this would be absurd since even the most famous stories will be familiar to only a minority, but are still pleasing to everyone.

It is clear from all of this that a writer should be a maker of plots more than of verses,47 for a tragic poet is a creator of imitations, and imitations are of actions.

Even if a dramatist writes about actual events, he is still a poet and not a historian. Some historical episodes are of course probable or possible—and it is the probable and possible from which writers take their material.

## A Brief Note on Bad Plots

Concerning plots and actions, the episodic are the worst. By *episodic* I mean those stories in which the sequence of events is neither necessary nor probable. Such plays are created by second-rate writers who lack talent or by good writers who are trying to give the actors something to show off with. In creating such stories they stretch the plot to extremes and distort the sequence of events.

## Astonishment in Plots

Tragedy isn’t just an imitation of complete or whole actions, but also of events that evoke pity and fear. The best way to achieve this is when events are unexpectedly connected and happen because of one another. This will be much more astonishing than if the events occur spontaneously or by chance, since even events that seem to have occurred by chance seem to have happened for a purpose. An example of this is when the statue of Mitys at Argos fell down and killed the murderer of Mitys as he looked up at it.48 Such events *seem* not to happen by chance—and plots like this are certainly better.

## Simple and Complex Plots

10. Plots can be either simple or complex, since the actions they imitate are themselves either simple or complex.

By a *simple* plot I mean complete and continuous, as I discussed above \(having a beginning, middle, and end\), and in which a change of fortune occurs without reversal or recognition. By a *complex* plot I mean one in which a change of fortune comes about with reversal or recognition or both. The reversal and recognition must come naturally from the plot structure so that they necessarily \(or at least probably\) are a result of what has happened previously in the story. There is an important difference between an event happening *because* of another event or simply *after* it.49

## Reversal

11. A *reversal* in a plot is the change of a situation into its opposite, as I’ve said before, but it must be in accord with probability or necessity.50

For example, in *Oedipus* a messenger comes to bring Oedipus good news and free him from his fear regarding his mother \(i.e., that he has already married her\). But by showing him who he really is, the messenger does the exact opposite.51 The same thing happens in *Lynceus* when the hero is brought in to die, followed by Danaus, who intends to kill him, but it turns out that Danaus is killed and Lynceus is saved.52

## Recognition

As the term indicates, *recognition*53 is a change from ignorance to knowledge resulting in either a close relationship or hatred between two people destined for good or bad fortune.

The best kind of recognition in a plot occurs simultaneously with reversal, as in *Oedipus*.

There are of course other kinds of recognition. The kind I’ve just described could conceivably be of inanimate objects or random things. It’s also possible to recognize that a person has or has not done an action. But the type of recognition that best fits plot and action is what I’ve mentioned, for this kind of recognition and reversal will evoke both pity and fear. And, as we’ve seen, tragedy is the imitation of such actions and the good or bad fortune that results from them.

Now, since recognition is between people, it will sometimes happen that only one of the two persons is recognized by the other. An example is when Iphigenia is recognized by Orestes when she sends the letter, but it takes a separate recognition scene for her to recognize him.54

## Suffering

So, these are the two parts of a tragic plot we have now discussed—reversal and recognition—but a third part is suffering.

*Suffering* is when something destructive or painful occurs in a story, such as a horrible death, violent physical agony, wounding someone, or anything else like that.

## The Technical Parts of a Greek Tragedy

12. We have previously looked at the qualities or basic elements a tragedy should have.55 But the separate parts into which a tragic drama should be divided are as follows:

+ *prologos* \(prologue\) 
+ *epeisodion* \(episode\) 
+ *exodos* \(finale\) 
+ *choral parts—*further divided into *parados* \(entry song\) and *stasimon* \(ode\) 

All tragedies have these basic parts, but some plays may also have actors’ songs and *kommoi* \(dirges\).

The *prologos* is the part of a tragedy before the *parodos* or entry song of the chorus. An *epeisodion* is the portion of a tragedy between complete choral songs. The *exodos* is the part of a tragedy after the final choral song. The *parodos* is the first complete utterance by the chorus. A *stasimon* is a choral song without anapests or trochaics.56 A *kommos* is a dirge shared by the chorus and actors.

We have now spoken of the basic qualities or elements that must be used in a tragedy and the parts into which it is divided.

## The Best Kind of Tragic Character

13. Now that we’ve covered the matters above, we should look at what a writer should strive for and avoid in constructing the best kind of plots, as well as how to achieve the greatest tragic effect in a story.

As we mentioned earlier, the best tragic plots are complex \(with reversal and recognition\), not simple, and should evoke pity and fear in an audience, since this is what imitation in tragedy does.

*Good person* → *bad outcome*: One key plot rule in tragedy is never have a truly admirable person undergo a change from good to bad fortune. This evokes only shock and disgust in an audience, not pity and fear.

*Bad person* → *good outcome*: Nor should you create a plot about a wicked person changing from bad fortune to happiness. This is the least tragic plot of all and produces none of the right effects since it is offensive to those watching and doesn’t evoke pity or fear.

*Bad person* → *bad outcome*: A story about an evil person going from good to bad fortune is also weak writing. Such a plot might be somewhat agreeable on the surface, but it doesn’t evoke the power of pity or fear, since we reserve our pity for undeserving victims of misfortune and our fear for people we identify with.

*Good \(enough\) person* → *bad outcome*: We are left then with the best tragic character being someone in-between—that is, neither terribly wicked nor a shining example of virtue.57 This person undergoes a downfall not through great wickedness or vice, but because of some mistake or weakness.58 This character should preferably be famous and prosperous, like Oedipus or Thyestes,59 or someone from a notable family.

## The Best Kind of Plot

A well-constructed plot in a tragedy ought to have a single story line rather than two, as some people claim. It should also not have a change from bad fortune to good, but—on the contrary—from good to bad. This change should not be caused by some depravity but by a serious error in a noble kind of person as we discussed earlier. This is supported by the history of tragic drama since earlier poets used to write about a multitude of things, but nowadays the best tragedies are composed about just a few families, such as those of Alcmaeon, Oedipus, Orestes, Meleager, Thyestes, Telephus, and any others who have experienced or caused some terrible misfortune.60

This is how the best dramas, in artistic terms, are constructed. Some critics complain about Euripides having single story lines and mostly tragic endings in his plays, but they are quite mistaken. This is in fact the correct way to construct a plot. The greatest proof of this is that in theatrical contests plays written as I have described are recognized as the most tragic, if performed well. Even if Euripides is faulty in other respects, he is certainly the most tragic of poets.

## The Double-Plot Happy Ending

The second-best structure—which some people consider the best—is the double-story-line plot, as we find in the *Odyssey*, in which the good are rewarded and the bad punished.61 Some consider this the best kind of plot because it is most pleasing to the audience—and writers are always trying to pander to the crowd.

But tragedy demands a different kind of pleasure from its viewers. Plays with happy endings are really more suited to comedy, where no one dies and you might even have deadly enemies like Orestes and Aegisthus march off the stage at the end as friends.62

## Plot Is Better Than Spectacle

14. In tragedy, pity and fear can be evoked through the spectacle of the stage or through the plot structure. But plot is the best way and should be the aim of the best writers, for the plot should be so strong that even those just hearing of it and not seeing it onstage will feel horror and pity about what happens \(as anyone would with *Oedipus*\). To create pity and fear with spectacle and special effects has little to do with the art of writing and more with how much money the producer spends on stagecraft. Those performances that use mere spectacle to evoke amazement and not fear have nothing to do with tragedy. We shouldn’t try to seek every variety of pleasure from tragedy, only those that belong to it—pity and fear—which the writer should bring about in the actions of the story by means of imitation.

## Family Conflicts Make the Best Tragedies

We should consider carefully what sort of conflicts in a tragedy evoke terror and pity. Such events must naturally occur between characters who are closely connected63 \(friends and family\), those who are enemies, or those who are neither.

*Enemies*: A conflict between people who hate each other isn’t particularly pitiable either while it’s happening or when we’re still anticipating it, except for the fact that some suffering occurs.

*Neutrals*: The same as enemies.

*Friends and family*: This is where a writer of tragedy should turn. The suffering that occurs between those who are in close relationships is best, whether brother against brother, son against father, mother against son, or son against mother—especially when one of them kills or is about to kill the other or commit some equally terrible deed.

## Characters Acting in Knowledge or Ignorance—Which Is Better?

We can’t change traditional story lines \(such as the murder of Clytemnestra by Orestes or Eriphyle’s death at the hands of Alcmaeon\).64 The task of the writer instead is to be creative and make good use of a given tradition.

Let me explain what I mean by this.

*Knowingly*: A tragic deed can be done, as it usually is in the early poets, with the full knowledge of the facts, as when Medea in the play of Euripides kills her own children.65

*Unknowingly*: A violent action can be taken in ignorance, as when Oedipus in the Sophocles tragedy kills his own father. Granted this happens outside the action of the drama, but it can happen in the course of a play, as with the Alcmaeon of Astydamas or Telegonus in *Odysseus Wounded*.66

*Last-minute reversal*: The third possibility is when a character is unaware of a close relationship but realizes it before the deed is actually done.

These are the only possibilities, since someone either acts or doesn’t and either knows or doesn’t.

The worst plot for a tragedy is to have a character fully know what he or she is about to do, but not do it. This isn’t tragic at all but shocking and brings about no necessary suffering. That is why no one writes stories with this plotline, or at least only rarely as with Haemon and Creon in *Antigone*.67 It’s much better to go ahead and do the wicked deed.

Even better is to have your character commit the crime in ignorance and recognize the truth afterward. In this way you don’t annoy the audience and the recognition is both terrifying and thrilling.

But the best choice is the last option, as in the *Cresphontes*, when Merope intends to kill her son but doesn’t do it at the last minute when she recognizes him, or in the *Iphigenia* with sister and brother, or the *Helle* when the son is about to hand over his mother but doesn’t after he recognizes her.68

And so, as I said earlier, tragedies usually limit their plots to a few families. It was chance and experiment rather than art that led early tragic writers to develop these effective plots in their stories. In doing so, they kept coming back by necessity to the same troubled families in which such terrible suffering had happened.

## Qualities You Need in Your Characters

15. We’ve said enough about plot and structure. Now let’s turn to characters and the four qualities a writer should include.

*Goodness*: This is most important. The qualities your characters have, as I said earlier, will be revealed in their speech and actions when they make deliberate moral choices. The characters are good if their choices are good. This is possible in every class of person, even slaves and women, though women are weaker and slaves inferior.69

*Appropriateness*: A character can be courageous, for example, but it would be inappropriate for a female character to be courageous or clever in the same way as a man.

*Relatability*: This is not the same as making the character have goodness or appropriateness, as I mentioned before.70

*Consistency*: Even if we were to imagine a character who is by nature inconsistent, in your story they should be consistently inconsistent.

## Examples of Bad Characterization

A character who is unnecessarily wicked is Menelaus in *Orestes*.71

Inappropriateness is clear in the lament of Odysseus in *Scylla* \(too womanly\) and also with Melanippe \(too intelligent\).72

For inconsistency, we have *Iphigenia at Aulis* in which the girl who begs for her life to be spared is nothing like she is later in the same play.73

In characterization as in plot, we should always aim at what is necessary or at least probable, so that a character says and does what is needed or likely and so that the sequence of events unfolds in the same way.

## No Deus Ex Machina Allowed

The solution to a plot problem should come from the story itself, not from some supernatural intervention as in the *Medea* or the departure scene in the *Iliad*.74 The supernatural should be used in a plot only for events outside the drama or for a necessary revealing of things beyond human knowledge, either long ago or in the future, for we say the gods can see all things.

There should be nothing irrational in the events of a story. If such things are needed, they should lie outside the play itself, as with Oedipus in Sophocles.75

## Creating Characters Is Like Painting a Portrait

Since tragedy is an imitation of people better than us, writers should be like good portrait painters. They represent individuals as they are in form, but they also make them especially good-looking.

In the same way, when imitating people who are easily angered or lazy or with other negative traits, the writer should take care to portray them as decent also. For example, Homer portrays Achilles as a good man, yet nevertheless a prime example of a harsh and obstinate person.76

It’s easy to make mistakes in such matters, so we should pay attention to these points and others that are crucial to the perceptions involved in the art of poetry. I have dealt with these in my other published works.77

## The Kinds of Recognition

16. We have already discussed what recognition is. The types are as follows:

+ *Signs*—Tokens or signs are the first and least artistic means of recognition. They are also the type people use the most because they require the least amount of writing talent. Some are found on a body from birth, such as “the spear-shaped birthmark of the Sons of Earth” or the stars Carcinus uses in his *Thyestes*.78 Other signs are acquired and are either on the body \(such as scars\) or external \(such as necklaces or the boat in *Tyro*\).79 But even signs can be put to better or worse use. For example, Odysseus is recognized differently because of his scar both by his old nurse bathing him and by the swineherds.80 Recognitions for the sake of proof and such are less artistic, but those that emerge from a reversal, as in the bathing of Odysseus, are better. 
+ *Invention*—Another type of inartistic recognition is one of invention by the writer. For example, in the *Iphigenia* Orestes reveals his own identity, while Iphigenia’s is revealed by a letter.81 Orestes simply declares what the writer—but not the plot—demands. This is so much like the previous type of recognition that Orestes might as well have carried some tokens. Another example is the “voice of the shuttle” in Sophocles’s *Tereus*.82 
+ *Memory*—The third type of recognition scene is when the sight of something brings remembrance and awareness. This kind of recognition occurs both in Dicaeogenes’s *Cyprians*, when he sees the painting and bursts into tears, and in the *Odyssey*, when Odysseus hears the song of his past and weeps while observed by Alcinous.83 
+ *Reasoning*—The fourth kind of recognition in a plot comes through inference and reason. In the *Libation Bearers*, Electra sees that someone like her has come. Since no one but Orestes is like her, Orestes himself therefore must have come.84 The sophist Polyidus does something similar for Iphigenia when he says it was probable that, since his sister had been sacrificed, it was likely for him as well. Also in Theodectes’s *Tydeus*, when the title character comes to find his son he realizes he was doomed himself. And again, in the *Sons of Phineus* the women see a place and reason it is their destiny to die there since that was where they were left to die as babies.85 
+ *Composite*—There is also a compound type of recognition that depends on false reasoning by the audience, as in *Odysseus the False Messenger*.86 The writer creates the premise that only Odysseus can bend the bow but also claims that he will recognize the bow he has not seen. Then he is recognized by this means, though the opposite was expected. This is a false inference. 
+ *Plot*—The best kind of recognition arises naturally from the course of events so that the emotional impact comes about by probable actions, as in Sophocles’s *Oedipus* and Euripides’s *Iphigenia* \(since it is probable she would want to send a letter\). This best type of recognition happens without tokens and necklaces. But the second-best type is recognition by reasoning. 

## Visualize the Action

17. When you’re constructing a plot and putting it into words, you should visualize what is happening as much as possible in your mind’s eye. If you do this vividly, as if you were watching it yourself, you will discover which actions fit the story and become aware of inconsistencies.

We can learn this lesson from Carcinus.87 In one of his plays the character Amphiaraus was on his way back from a temple, but the audience didn’t realize it. The play failed miserably because those watching were angry about this.

## Feel the Emotions of Your Characters

You should also work out the gestures and emotions of your plot.

The writers who are most successful are those who by nature are able to identify with their characters and are gripped by their emotions. The truest anger or distress is conveyed by authors who actually feel anger or distress in their soul.

Thus the best writers are those who are either highly gifted or insane.

The gifted ones have versatile imaginations, but the latter have lost their minds.

## How to Build Your Plot

Whether drawing on an earlier story or creating one, a writer should first outline the overall structure of the story, then fill in the episodes and details.

When I say outline the overall structure, consider the following example from *Iphigenia*:
>  
> A girl who had been readied for sacrifice mysteriously disappears.

> ↓

> She is made a priestess in a foreign land where she must sacrifice strangers to a goddess.

> ↓

> The brother of the priestess arrives in the land \(that an oracle of the god told him to go there and why it isn’t outside the overall structure\).

> ↓

> The brother is captured on arrival and is about to be sacrificed, when he causes his sister to recognize him \(whether as in Euripides or as in Polyidus, by saying, as is probable, that he like his sister was fated to be sacrificed\).

> ↓

> The brother is saved.

After this you need to assign names and work out the details of the episodes.

But the episodes must be appropriate and integral to the whole, for example, in the case of Orestes, the fit of madness that causes his capture and the rite of purification that leads to him being saved.88

In plays, episodes are concise, but in epics they are drawn out and thus make that genre longer. The basic story outline of the *Odyssey* is not in fact long: A man is away from home for many years → he is alone and watched by Poseidon → at home his goods are being consumed by suitors who conspire to kill his son → the man returns home after being shipwrecked → he allows some people to recognize him → he attacks and kills his enemies → then he is safe.

That is the essential plot of the *Odyssey*. The rest is details.

## Untying the Knot

18. Every tragic story has both a complication and a resolution.89

The complication consists of events outside the play and often some events within it. The remainder is the resolution.

By *complication* I mean everything from the beginning up to the part just before the transformation to good or bad fortune. The *resolution* is from the beginning of the change of fortune until the end.

Thus in the *Lynceus* of Theodectes the complication consists of events before the play up to the seizure of the child, then the resolution is from the accusation of murder to the end.90

## The Kinds of Tragedy

There are four kinds of tragedy, just as there are four components of tragedy we mentioned earlier:91

1. *Complex tragedy*—the heart of which is reversal and recognition. 
2. *Tragedy of suffering*—such as those about Ajax and Ixion.92 
3. *Character-based tragedy*—like *Women of Phthia* and *Peleus*.93 
4. *Simple tragedy*—as with *Daughters of Phorcys*, *Prometheus*, and those set in Hades.94 

Ideally a writer should include in each play all the qualities that make a tragedy great, but failing that include the best or at least most of them—especially since critics are so picky nowadays. Because there have been some writers who are good at each of the qualities, people expect every author to be outstanding at all of them.

But the proper and most important way to compare and judge tragedies is by plot, that is, how the writers handle both complication and resolution. Some writers are good at creating complications, but bad at resolutions. Excellence at both is what makes a great story.

## Don’t Confuse Tragedy and Epic

As I’ve said before several times, a writer must avoid turning tragedy into epic \(and by epic I mean a story with multiple plots\). An example of this would be trying to make the whole of the *Iliad* into a play for the stage.

In epic, because of its great size, the different sections are all given an appropriate length. But in tragedy such length would be contrary to the very nature of drama.

Proof of this folly is those writers who have actually tried to put the whole fall of Troy into a single play \(as opposed to someone like Euripides, who portrayed only a part of it\) or to put the entire story of Niobe into one tragedy \(instead of what Aeschylus did\).95 Those writers who have attempted this have been hissed off the stage or at least done poorly in drama contests. Even Agathon failed in this respect.

## Even Weak Writing Works Sometimes

In simple action stories, writers can use a surprising reversal of fortune to achieve a satisfying tragic result for the audience. This happens when a clever but wicked character \(like Sisyphus\) is deceived or when a brave but unjust person is defeated.96 As Agathon says, it is probable that many improbable things should happen in such stories.

## The Chorus

The chorus in a tragedy should be treated as one of the actors. It should be a key part of the whole and contribute to the action—as Sophocles did it, not Euripides.

In more recent dramatists, the choral songs are no more a part of the story line than in other plays. They are mere interludes between action—a practice started by Agathon. But what is the difference between this and inserting a whole speech or scene from another play into your own?

## Reasoning and Speech

19. We have now discussed the other components of writing tragedy. What remains is reasoning and speech itself.

For reasoning, I refer readers to my *Rhetoric*, since the topic is more appropriate there. Reasoning in drama includes those effects that are created by speech, namely proof, refutation, the production of emotions \(pity, fear, anger, etc.\), and also making things appear important or unimportant.

Clearly the events and actions of a play should also convey these emotions, whether a writer wants to evoke something pitiable, terrible, important, or probable. The only difference is that some of these emotions are conveyed by actions, whereas emotions created by speech are done with words. After all, what would be the point of having actors speak if everything could be conveyed without the use of language?

## We Will Not Look at Every Aspect of Speech

As for speech, one branch of its study is to examine different modes of expression, such as the difference between command, prayer, narration, threat, questioning, answering, and anything else of that kind. All this belongs to the craft of vocal delivery by an actor and those who are experts at it. Knowledge of such matters isn’t important to literary critics since it isn’t really something worth taking seriously.97 After all, why should anyone be concerned with the comments of Protagoras when he criticizes the first line of Homer’s *Iliad* \(“Sing, goddess, of the anger …\), claiming it isn’t in fact a prayer but a command since the author uses the imperative? So, let’s consider this as belonging to some other type of study than poetry.

## Linguistics and Grammar—the Building Blocks of Storytelling

20. Language as a whole is made up of the following parts: letter, syllable, connective, noun, verb, conjunction, inflection, and statement:

1. A *letter* is a single indivisible sound, but one that is the building block of more complex utterances. But it must have meaning, for animals can also produce individual sounds, none of which I would call letters. Letters can be further broken down into vowels, continuants, and stops:

+ A *vowel* is an audible sound produced without any parts of the mouth touching each other. 
+ A *continuant* is an audible sound produced with parts of the mouth touching but not blocking airflow \(e.g., *s* or *r*\). 
+ A *stop* is made when parts of the mouth touch each other and block airflow \(e.g., *g* or *d*\). It has no sound in itself, but only when combined with a vowel or continuant, which has an audible sound. 

Different letters are produced by shaping the mouth in different ways, by different parts of the mouth touching each other, by the presence or absence of aspiration \(i.e., expelling air\), by length or shortness, and by the pitch of the accent given them \(rising, falling, rising/falling\).98 A careful examination of all this is part of the study of verse forms and meter.

2. A *syllable* is a sound without meaning in itself that compounds with a stop and a vowel or continuant. For example, *gr* \(stop \+ continuant\) is a syllable without a vowel, just as *gra* \(stop \+ continuant \+ vowel\) is a syllable with a vowel. But a detailed discussion of this also belongs with the study of verse forms and meter.

3.99 A *connective* is a sound without meaning in itself that neither prevents not creates the formation of a meaningful phrase in a combination of sounds. It usually stands at the end or the middle of a sentence, but not at the start. Examples are *men*, *dê*, *toi*, and *de*.100 A connective can also be a sound without meaning in itself but that makes surrounding sounds meaningful, such as the prepositions *amphi* and *peri* \(around, about\).

4. A *conjunction* is a sound without meaning in itself that stands at the beginning or end or a division point of a sentence.101

5. A *noun* is a combination of sounds with meaning, but it tells you nothing about the time in which it takes place. Compound nouns are made up of nouns that in themselves have no functional meaning, as in the *-dorus* of the name *Theo-dorus*.102

6. A *verb* is a combination of sounds with meaning that does tell you the time in which an action takes place. But just as with nouns no part of it has separate functional meaning. Nouns like “person” or “white” tell you nothing about time, but verbs like “is walking” or “has walked” signify present and past time, respectively.

7. An *inflection* of a noun or verb is an aspect that signifies case \(subject, object, etc.\) with nouns or number \(singular or plural\) with verbs. It also applies to modes of expression such as interrogative \(“Did he walk?”\) or imperative \(“Walk\!”\).

8. A *statement* is a combination of sounds with meaning, the parts of which may have functional meanings themselves. Not every statement has both a noun and a verb, such as the definition of *person* \(i.e., “rational animal”\). We can have statements without verbs, but some part will always have a separate significance \(e.g., *Cleon* in “Cleon is walking” has a meaning of its own\). A statement can be a unity in two ways, either because it signifies a single object \(as in the definition of a human being\) or because it connects many utterances \(as the whole *Iliad* could be thought of as a single statement because it is a unity of many utterances\).

## The Wonderful Versatility of Nouns

21. Nouns can be single—by which I mean they only have one part, like *gê* \(earth\)—or double. These double nouns can be divided into words formed both by significant and by insignificant parts \(though the parts don’t have this difference in nature within the noun\) or, secondly, those that are created from only significant parts.103

There can even be nouns that have three, four, or even more parts, like *Hermocaïcoxanthus*, a grandiose word from the Greek city of Massalia in Gaul.104

Aside from the number of elements that form it, a noun can also be classified as current, borrowed, metaphorical, ornamental, coined, lengthened, shortened, or adapted.

1. A *current* noun is one used regularly by everyone in a community.

2. A *borrowed* noun is one used by outsiders. Obviously a noun can be both current and borrowed by different groups. The word *sigunon* is what the people of Cyprus call a spear, but we borrow it from them.

3. A *metaphor* is using one meaning for something else. There are four types:

+ *General in place of specific* \(*genus to species*\): As in “my ship stands here.” Lying at anchor is a specific kind of standing. 
+ *Specific in place of general* \(*species to genus*\): “Odysseus has accomplished ten thousand noble deeds.”105 The number “ten thousand” is a specific large number that stands for the general term “many.” 
+ *Borrowing from a different class* \(*species to species*\): “Drawing off the life with bronze” or “Cutting with slender-edged bronze.” Here “drawing off” means killing an animal, and “cutting” means drawing off water. 
+ *Analogy*: By this I mean, for example, *B* is to *A* as *D* is to *C*, so then you can use *D* for *B* or *B* for *D*. You can then switch related terms. For example, a wine bowl is to the god Dionysus what the shield is to the god Ares, so you could say by analogy “the shield of Dionysus” or “the wine bowl of Ares.” To give another example, old age is to life as evening is to the day, so you could call evening “the day’s old age” or, like Empedocles does, call old age “the evening of life” or “life’s twilight.”106 Sometimes this is hard to do because there isn’t an existing noun for one part of the analogy, but we can still find ways to express it. For example, scattering seed is “sowing,” but there isn’t a noun for scattering fire from the sun. However, scattering fire from the sun stands in relation to the sun as sowing does to the seed, thus the phrase that the sun is “sowing his divine fire.” Another way to use an analogical metaphor is if you add the quality of the transferred item but then negate it, for example, if you called a shield not “the cup of Ares” but “a wineless wine bowl.” 

4. An *ornamental* noun is …107

5. A *coined* noun is a word that didn’t exist before it was made up by the writer. There are few examples of this, but two would be *ernuges* \(sprouts\) for *kerata* \(horns\) and *arêtêr* \(one who prays\) for *hiereus* \(priest\).

6. A *lengthened* or *shortened* noun uses a longer \(also extra syllable\) or shorter vowel \(something removed\) than normal. Examples of lengthening are *polêos* for *poleos* \(of a city\) or *Pêlêiadeô* for *Pêleidou*. For shortening, *kri* \(for *krithê*, “barley”\) and *dô* \(for *dôma*, “house”\) and “from two eyes single *ops*” \(for *opsis*, “sight”\).

7. An *adapted* noun is one in which part of the word is kept unchanged but another part altered. For example, “in his right \(*dexiteron*\) breast” instead of *dexion*.

* * *

Nouns themselves are either masculine, feminine, or neuter.108 Masculine nouns end in *n*, *r*, or *s* \(or the compounds *ps* and *ks*\). Feminine nouns end in vowels that are always long \(*ê* and *ô*\) or in *a* \(among the vowels that can be lengthened\). So the number of masculine and feminine noun endings is the same, since *ps* and *ks* are simply forms of *s*. No noun ends in a stop or a short vowel. Only three nouns end in *i* \(*meli*, “honey”; *kommi*, “gum”; and *peperi*, “pepper”\), while five end in *u*—*doru* \(wood\), *pôu* \(flock\), *napu* \(mustard\), *gonu* \(knee\), and *astu* \(city\). Neuter nouns have these same endings, but also *n* and *s*.

## The Elements of Style

22. The most important thing in the language of storytelling is to be clear, but not too ordinary.

The clearest kind of writing uses everyday speech, though this is too common and pedestrian. Cleophron and Sthenelus are examples of this.109

Language is impressive and distinguished if you use words that are uncommon—by which I mean foreign words, metaphors, lengthened forms, and all other more elevated usage. But if your whole story is written like this it’s going to be nothing but riddles or gibberish \(riddles if it it’s all metaphors and gibberish if nothing but exotic words\). After all, the essence of a riddle is to describe real things by combining them in an impossible way. This can’t be done by simply putting random words together, but you can do it with metaphors \(e.g., “I saw a man welding bronze on a man with fire”\).110 And stories with an abundance of foreign words are going to sound *très sauvage*.

What a writer should aim for in language is a mixture of the special and the ordinary. Elevated words—like foreign terms, metaphors, ornamental words, and the other things I mentioned earlier—make your language stand out and give it a certain dignity. Everyday language, on the other hand, will give your writing clarity.

One thing that makes poetry both unusual and yet clear is to use metrical lengthenings, abbreviations, and modifications of words.111 If you do this, you will make your language different and out of the ordinary, but still enough like normal language so that it should be clear. Those people who criticize this technique and mock poets for it are mistaken. Eucleides carped on about this and said it was easy to write poetry if you could ignore all the rules and lengthen words at will. He even satirized Homer and composed nonsense lampoons in the style of Homer using ridiculous vowel lengthenings like: “I saw *Eee*pichares w*aaa*lking to Marathon” and “not m*iiii*xing his hell*eee*b*ooo*re.”112

This sort of thing is absurd since moderation is key in all matters of style. If you used metaphors, foreign words, or other such elements in an inappropriate and ridiculous way it would produce the same effect. The effect of inappropriateness could just as easily be seen if you inserted everyday words into epic poetry, or if you replaced special words, metaphors, and such with common words. For example, consider how Aeschylus and Euripides composed the same iambic line, but Euripides chose to replace a single common word with a more elevated term, changing a trivial line of poetry into an elevated one. Aeschylus wrote in his *Philoctetes*:

*“the cancer that eats the flesh of my foot”*

but Euripides improved it with:

*“the cancer that feasts on the flesh of my foot.”*113

And likewise, you could replace a beautiful line such as:

*“a lowly, paltry, and unseemly man”*114

with something very dull like:

*“a small, weak, and ugly man.”*

Or replace:

*“setting out an uncomely chair and lowly table”*115

with:

*“setting out an ugly chair and short table.”*

And again change:

*“the shores resound”*116

to something trivial like:

*“the shores make noise.”*

Ariphrades also made fun of tragic playwrights for penning words no one would use in everyday conversation, such as “the palace from” \(instead of “from the palace”\) or “of thine” or “I him” or “Achilles around” \(rather than “around Achilles”\). But this kind of usage is what lifts poetic language out of the ordinary and gives it such an impression. Ariphrades simply didn’t understand this.117

An important rule of style is to use appropriately all these things I’ve mentioned, including double nouns and loan words. But the most important thing is to be good at using metaphors. This is one skill you can’t learn from someone else. It is quite simply a natural talent for those who have it—for the proper use of metaphors is perceiving similarities.

Compound words are most useful in dithyrambic choral songs, and loan words are best for epic poetry. But metaphors are most suited for iambic verse in tragedy. Actually you can use all of the above in epic, but iambic verse is most similar to ordinary speech and uses words you most often would use as well in prose—namely everyday words, metaphors, and ornamentals.

Let this then be an end to the discussion of tragedy and imitation on the stage.

## How to Use Plot in an Epic

23. As for the use of imitation in epic, it should of course have a clear dramatic plot structure as in tragedy. That is, your story should be built around a single, whole, and complete action with a beginning, middle, and end \(like a living organism\), and this plot should give your audience the proper pleasure and satisfaction.

Epics should not be organized like histories, for these require the story not of a single action but of a single time period. Histories examine all the events that happen to one or more persons in one period of time whether they are related to each other or not. The naval battle at Salamis happened at the same time as the battle against the Carthaginians in Sicily, but the two events had nothing to do with each other.118 In the same way, events in time sometimes follow each other without any connection or common end. Still, you sadly see so many authors of epics writing in this chronological way.

And so, as I said earlier, Homer’s inspired excellence in respect to other poets is clear in this respect as well. Although he has a beginning and end, he doesn’t try to cover the whole Trojan War in the *Iliad*. If he had, the plot would have been much too large and impossible to comprehend in one story. Instead he covers only one small part of the war, though he uses the episode on the catalogue of ships and other such episodes to work in other incidents.119 The other poets from the Epic Cycle build their plots around a single figure, one period in the war, or, opposite of this, an action with many parts, such as the poet of the *Cypria* and *Little Iliad* does.120 This means you could at best compose one tragedy or maybe two from the plot of the *Iliad* or *Odyssey*, but you could create many tragedies from the *Cypria* and *Little Iliad*—over eight actually: *The Judgment of Arms*, *Philoctetes*, *Neoptolemus*, *Eurypylus*, *Odysseus the Beggar*, *The Spartan Women*, *The Sack of Troy*, and *The Departure of the Greek Fleet*, as well as *Sinon* and *The Trojan Women*.121

## Types and Parts of Epics

24. Epic should have the same basic elements as tragedy, either simple or complex and based either on character or on suffering. The parts of epic are also the same, except for adding music and the spectacle of staging. And just like tragedy, epic also needs reversals, recognition, and scenes of suffering, as well as reasoning and speech.

All these elements were employed first by Homer, who used them very well, though his epic poems differ. The *Iliad* is simple in plot and rich in suffering, while the *Odyssey* is complex, full of recognition scenes, and based on character. In addition, Homer is the best of authors at reasoning and speech.

## The Differences between Tragedy and Epic

Epic differs from tragic drama because of its greater length and because it uses a different verse form. The definition of appropriate length I gave before is adequate \(a reader should be able to see the whole thing, beginning and end, at once in the mind’s eye\). This can be done with plots shorter than the early epics, corresponding to the length of a group of three tragedies viewed at one sitting.

Epic has a special quality that allows it to be longer. In tragedy the plot cannot of course cover simultaneous actions at once since there is only one stage. But epic, because it is a narrative, can cover many actions taking place at the same time. If these simultaneous actions fit together as a whole, they can make an epic a powerful story. Thus epic has the advantage of variety and a diversity of episodes that contribute to its grandeur. Tragedy lacks this variety and can grow dull and tedious, causing many tragedies to fail.

As for the verse form used in epic, the appropriateness of heroic hexameter has been proven by experience. If you were to compose a narrative poem in some other poetic meter or mixed several types of meters, it simply wouldn’t work as well. Heroic verse is the most stately and grand of meters. It also adapts well to loan words and metaphors, giving epic a flexibility greater than that of other genres. The rhythms of iambic trimeter and trochaic tetrameter almost demand movement and excitement, for they are, respectively, the meters of action and dance.122 Even worse than an epic in one of these two meters would be one that mixed meters, as in the work of Chaeremon. This is why no one has written a longer epic in any meter other than heroic. As I said before, the nature of the story itself teaches us what is appropriate.

## It’s Not about You—Why Writers Should Stay Out of the Story

Homer deserves praise above other poets for many reasons, but most of all because he knows when not to use his own voice. A storyteller should say as little as possible as a narrator, since this isn’t imitation. Other authors insert their own voices in their stories throughout and use imitation seldom if ever. But Homer, after speaking in a very brief introduction, steps back and brings forward a man, woman, or some other interesting character to take over the narrative.

## Marvels and Wonders

Tragic drama should make people feel awe and wonder. As for epic, in which the audience isn’t actually watching the action onstage, there is even more of an opportunity for the astonishing, which is the cause of awe and wonder.

If someone tried to put the scene from the *Iliad* onstage in which Hector is pursued by Achilles around Troy,123 it would look ridiculous, with actors standing around while Achilles tells them to stay away. But in epic, this works perfectly well.

To feel awe and wonder is a pleasant thing. Proof of this is that we delight in exaggerating when we tell a story to impress and delight our listeners.

Homer is the best of all authors at telling untrue stories. The way he does this is by using a logical fallacy:
>  
> *B follows from A*

> ↓

> *B occurs*

> ↓

> *Therefore A must have happened or be happening*

But this of course isn’t actually the case. In our minds, if the second is true then we falsely assume the first must be as well.124 An example of this again comes from the bathing scene of the *Odyssey*.125

In stories, what is impossible but believable is preferable to what is possible but unconvincing.126

As far as possible, stories shouldn’t contain any unbelievable parts. It would be best if they contained none, but if they must, they should lie outside the narration \(like Oedipus not knowing how his father, Laius, died\) or not in the play itself \(like the appearance of the Pythian games in Sophocles’s *Electra*, or the silent man who comes from Tegea to Mysia in the *Mysians*\).127 The excuse that a plot would be ruined without unbelievable elements is ridiculous, since there’s no reason to include them in the first place. If a writer includes some irrational element and there was a reasonable alternative available, this is unforgiveable. Even so, the inconsistencies of Odysseus being put ashore by the Phaeacians would be intolerable if a second-rate writer had included them, but they work because Homer uses his gifts as a writer to obscure them.128

## Lofty Language

A writer should save elaborate speech for the parts of a story where there is little action, not much presentation of character, and little complex reasoning going on. Overly brilliant language overshadows character and thought.

## Principles of Writing

25. Before approaching problems in writing and their solutions, the following principles should be kept in mind as we clarify the numbers and types:

+ Writers are imitators, just like painters or other kinds of visual artists. Logically therefore writers must imitate things either as they are \(or were\), as people say and think they are, or as they ought to be. 
+ Writers have the license to use borrowed words, metaphors, and unusual language. 
+ Writers and artists in telling their stories are not bound to the same moral standards as others are in their public and private lives. 
+ Writers can make two kinds of errors: internal and external. If a writer tries to imitate something accurately and fails to do so because of incompetence, the fault is internal and belongs to the writer alone. But if a writer deliberately chooses to misrepresent something for artistic reasons \(like describing a horse with two right legs thrown forward while running\), then the fault is anatomical but not artistic.129 

## Solving Problems in Writing and Literary Criticism

Given these basic principles, here are ways to resolve some of the common problems that occur in writing \(and reading\) a text:

+ First, regarding the crafting of the story itself, if the plot contains something impossible, then that is a mistake. The only way it’s not a mistake is if it attains the goal of storytelling stated above, that is, it makes this or some other part of the story more wondrous. An example of this is Achilles chasing Hector around Troy, as I mentioned above. But if it’s possible to achieve the same effect or do even better without taxing the rules of logic, then that is what you should do. The best writers don’t make mistakes if they can help it. 
+ What kind of mistake is a writer making? It depends if the mistake concerns the craft of writing itself or something less important. If an artist paints a beautiful female deer with horns, that wouldn’t be as bad as painting an altogether ugly imitation of a deer. 
+ If a critic says that a writer is producing something false, well, perhaps that’s as it should be. After all, Sophocles said he created characters as they should be \(though Euripides claims he represented them as they really are\). 
+ If your representations are neither true nor as they ideally ought to be, you can always fall back on the excuse that people *say* things are like that. For example, if you write about the gods, you may not be saying something ideal or true \(maybe Xenophanes130 was right\), but you can respond: “Well, that’s what people believe.” 
+ Or you could respond that you’re not writing about how things *are* but how they *were* in the past. For example, in the passage of the *Iliad* in which “their spears stood upright on the butt end”—that was how things were done back then, even as the Illyrians still do today.131 
+ As to whether your character is saying or doing something right or wrong, you have to take into account not just the morality of the words or actions but which character is saying or doing them, who the character is talking to or dealing with, when this occurs in the story, and how things turn out in the end. That is, did your character saying or doing something bad bring about a greater good or avert something evil? 
+ Sometimes criticisms can be countered by looking closely at the words used in a story. For example, realizing an author has used a nonstandard word can solve a puzzle: “\[Apollo sent the plague\] first on the mules \(*ourêas*\)”—here Homer probably in fact used the word *ourêes* \(sentinels\).132 Or when Homer calls Dolon “misshapen in form” \(*eidos*\), this may not mean that his body is ill proportioned but that his face only is disfigured, since Cretans call facial beauty *eueides*,133 or when he has Achilles say, “mix the wine stronger \(*zôroteron*\),” as if he were trying to get them drunk, but in fact means “mix the wine more quickly.”134 
+ A similar misunderstanding can occur when language is used metaphorically, as when Homer says, “*all* the gods and men slept through the night” at the same time he says that Zeus “looked out over the Trojan plain and marveled at the sound of reed pipes and pipes.”135 The word *all* has been used metaphorically for *many*, since all is like many. Similarly, when Homer says the Great Bear constellation “*alone* has no share \(in the baths of the Ocean\),” he means the best known stands for the rest.136 
+ A different pronunciation can also lead to misunderstandings, as Hippias of Thasus noted in the Homeric lines “we grant him” and “the part rotted by rain.”137 
+ Changing the punctuation of a line can also solve problems, as when Empedocles wrote: “immediately things became mortal that before had known immortality, and unmixed before became mixed.”138 
+ Recognizing ambiguity is sometimes helpful as well. For example, “more of the night has passed”—in which “more” is ambiguous.139 
+ Understanding customary usage can also clarify a difficult passage. People still call wine “wine” even when it’s mixed with something else, thus the same applies to Homer’s “greaves of well-forged tin.”140 And in the same way we call people who work with iron “bronze smiths,” so Ganymede is described as “pouring wine for Zeus” even though the gods don’t drink wine.141 This could also be classified as a metaphor. 
+ Whenever a word seems to imply a contradiction, we should consider how many different senses and meanings that word may have. For example, when Homer says: “and the bronze spear was stopped there,” we should consider the different senses of “stopped” and choose the best definition for the particular text.142 Of course this is the opposite of what Glaucon describes when he says that some critics approach a text with unreasonable prior assumptions, then base their critique of the work on their false prejudgments. If something contradicts their opinion, they simply blame it on the writer as if he held the same assumptions they do\! The case of Icarius, the father of Penelope, is a good example. People assume he was Spartan, so criticize Homer that Telemachus didn’t meet him when he went to Sparta. Perhaps the Cephallenians are right when they say Odysseus married a woman of their people and that her father’s name was Icadius and not Icarius.143 So in this case the literary problem is based on a mistaken premise. 

## Other Problems in Criticism

In general, we should judge the use of impossibilities in stories by what effect they have, what the ideal is, and how they relate to popular belief.

With regard to effect, once again something impossible but believable is preferable to something possible but unconvincing. Consider the paintings of Zeuxis that portray people too perfect to actually exist. They are an impossible ideal and rightly should be portrayed better than someone who could possibly exist.

Again, the impossible in stories may sometimes be justified by appealing to common opinion.

And of course the impossible may turn out to be possible after all, for seemingly impossible things sometimes do happen.

Apparent contradictions in a story should be examined with the kind of scrutiny we would use when refuting an argument. Are both cases actually saying the same thing? Are they in the same relation to each other? Are they meant in the same sense? This should tell us if the contradiction is in the writer or in what a reasonable person would assume.

But criticism of a writer is fair when there is something irrational or depraved in a story and it isn’t necessary, as with the senseless arrival of Aegeus in Euripides or the wickedness of Menelaus in Euripides’s *Orestes*.144

And so there are five kinds of objections critics make, saying something in a story is either impossible, irrational, harmful, contradictory, or contrary to artistic standards. Answers to these criticisms should be sought in the twelve solutions I have listed.145

## Argument: Epic Is Better Than Tragedy

26. Someone might reasonably ask if imitation in tragedy or epic is better—that is, which is better for telling a story?

Consider this argument: If the more tasteful art is always superior and what appeals to a better kind of audience is always best, then it’s perfectly clear that art that displays everything is more lowly and common. Those who practice such art assume that the audience is incapable of understanding anything the actors don’t make very clear onstage through movement and gesticulation \(like second-rate pipe players who whirl themselves around when they pretend to throw a discus or pretend to maul their chorus leader if the play is about the monster Scylla\).

According to this argument, tragedy is like this. Actors from the old days certainly felt this way about later drama. Mynniscus called Callippides a monkey because of his exaggerated movements, and Pindarus was viewed the same way.146

As the older actors are to the younger, so is epic to tragedy. And so people argue that epic is addressed to a decent and respectable sort of audience who don’t need movement and gestures, but tragedy is aimed at second-rate audiences who need visuals.

And thus the argument is that if tragedy is more common and vulgar, it’s obviously less worthy.

## Response: Tragedy Is Actually Better Than Epic

This is how we should reply to such an argument:

+ The above is a criticism of performance, not tragedy itself. A rhapsode performing epic poetry for an audience can also use exaggerated gestures \(like Sosistratus\). So can singers, like Mnasitheus the Opountian.147 
+ Not all movement—or dancing—in tragic performances should be discouraged, only that done by crude performers such as the notorious Callippides and other actors who portrayed women in a vulgar way onstage.148 
+ Tragedy achieves its effect even without movement, just as epic does. You can prove this simply by reading it. So if tragedy is in fact inferior, at least this argument against it doesn’t hold. 
+ Furthermore, tragedy can do everything epic can, even using epic verse form on occasion. And its use of music and spectacle is wonderfully pleasing. 
+ Even in just reading tragedy and not in performance, it has great vividness. 
+ The shorter length of tragedy as compared to epic achieves the goal of imitation in a shorter period of time. A concentrated performance is more pleasing than a longer and more diluted one—as would be the case if you made Sophocles’s *Oedipus* as long as the *Iliad*. 
+ The imitation that takes place in epic poetry is less unified than tragedy. Indeed, any epic could be turned into several tragedies. If writers of epic choose a single story, either they must make it brief with an abrupt ending, or it has an epic length and is diluted. But epics contain multiple actions, such as the *Iliad* and *Odyssey* with their many lengthy parts \(these two poems are constructed in the best possible way and overall each is as close as possible to the imitation of a single action\). 

Tragedy actually surpasses epic in all these respects, as well as in its artistic effect, since every art should produce a specific and appropriate type of pleasure.

Therefore, in the end, we can say that tragedy achieves its purpose better than epic and is the superior kind of storytelling.

## Conclusion

We are now done with our discussion of tragedy and epic, including all the different types and parts of each, the number of differences between them, why they succeed or fail, and the problems raised by critics along with appropriate answers to these criticisms.

And now let us turn to comedy …149

Διὸ καὶ ἀντιποιοῦνται τῆς τε τραγῳδίας καὶ τῆς κωμῳδίας οἱ Δωριεῖς \(τῆς μὲν γὰρ κωμῳδίας οἱ Μεγαρεῖς οἵ τε ἐνταῦθα ὡς ἐπὶ τῆς παρ᾽ αὐτοῖς δημοκρατίας γενομένης καὶ οἱ ἐκ Σικελίας, ἐκεῖθεν γὰρ ἦν Ἐπίχαρμος ὁ ποιητὴς πολλῷ πρότερος ὢν Χιωνίδου καὶ Μάγνητος· καὶ τῆς τραγῳδίας ἔνιοι τῶν ἐν Πελοποννήσῳ\) ποιούμενοι τὰ ὀνόματα σημεῖον· αὐτοὶ μὲν γὰρ κώμας τὰς περιοικίδας καλεῖν φασιν, Ἀθηναίους δὲ δήμους, ὡς κωμῳδοὺς οὐκ ἀπὸ τοῦ κωμάζειν λεχθέντας ἀλλὰ τῇ κατὰ κώμας πλάνῃ ἀτιμαζομένους ἐκ τοῦ ἄστεως· καὶ τὸ ποιεῖν αὐτοὶ μὲν δρᾶν, Ἀθηναίους δὲ πράττειν προσαγορεύειν.

Περὶ μὲν οὖν τῶν διαφορῶν καὶ πόσαι καὶ τίνες τῆς μιμήσεως εἰρήσθω ταῦτα.





 

4. Ἐοίκασι δὲ γεννῆσαι μὲν ὅλως τὴν ποιητικὴν αἰτίαι δύο τινὲς καὶ αὗται φυσικαί. τό τε γὰρ μιμεῖσθαι σύμφυτον τοῖς ἀνθρώποις ἐκ παίδων ἐστὶ καὶ τούτῳ διαφέρουσι τῶν ἄλλων ζῴων ὅτι μιμητικώτατόν ἐστι καὶ τὰς μαθήσεις ποιεῖται διὰ μιμήσεως τὰς πρώτας, καὶ τὸ χαίρειν τοῖς μιμήμασι πάντας. σημεῖον δὲ τούτου τὸ συμβαῖνον ἐπὶ τῶν ἔργων· ἃ γὰρ αὐτὰ λυπηρῶς ὁρῶμεν, τούτων τὰς εἰκόνας τὰς μάλιστα ἠκριβωμένας χαίρομεν θεωροῦντες, οἷον θηρίων τε μορφὰς τῶν ἀτιμοτάτων καὶ νεκρῶν. αἴτιον δὲ καὶ τούτου, ὅτι μανθάνειν οὐ μόνον τοῖς φιλοσόφοις ἥδιστον ἀλλὰ καὶ τοῖς ἄλλοις ὁμοίως, ἀλλ᾽ ἐπὶ βραχὺ κοινωνοῦσιν αὐτοῦ. διὰ γὰρ τοῦτο χαίρουσι τὰς εἰκόνας ὁρῶντες, ὅτι συμβαίνει θεωροῦντας μανθάνειν καὶ συλλογίζεσθαι τί ἕκαστον, οἷον ὅτι οὗτος ἐκεῖνος· ἐπεὶ ἐὰν μὴ τύχῃ προεωρακώς, οὐχ ᾗ μίμημα ποιήσει τὴν ἡδονὴν ἀλλὰ διὰ τὴν ἀπεργασίαν ἢ τὴν χροιὰν ἢ διὰ τοιαύτην τινὰ ἄλλην αἰτίαν.

Κατὰ φύσιν δὲ ὄντος ἡμῖν τοῦ μιμεῖσθαι καὶ τῆς ἁρμονίας καὶ τοῦ ῥυθμοῦ \(τὰ γὰρ μέτρα ὅτι μόρια τῶν ῥυθμῶν ἐστι φανερὸν\) ἐξ ἀρχῆς οἱ πεφυκότες πρὸς αὐτὰ μάλιστα κατὰ μικρὸν προάγοντες ἐγέννησαν τὴν ποίησιν ἐκ τῶν αὐτοσχεδιασμάτων.

Διεσπάσθη δὲ κατὰ τὰ οἰκεῖα ἤθη ἡ ποίησις· οἱ μὲν γὰρ σεμνότεροι τὰς καλὰς ἐμιμοῦντο πράξεις καὶ τὰς τῶν τοιούτων, οἱ δὲ εὐτελέστεροι τὰς τῶν φαύλων, πρῶτον ψόγους ποιοῦντες, ὥσπερ ἕτεροι ὕμνους καὶ ἐγκώμια. τῶν μὲν οὖν πρὸ Ὁμήρου οὐδενὸς ἔχομεν εἰπεῖν τοιοῦτον ποίημα, εἰκὸς δὲ εἶναι πολλούς, ἀπὸ δὲ Ὁμήρου ἀρξαμένοις ἔστιν, οἷον ἐκείνου ὁ Μαργίτης καὶ τὰ τοιαῦτα. ἐν οἷς κατὰ τὸ ἁρμόττον καὶ τὸ ἰαμβεῖον ἦλθε μέτρον—διὸ καὶ ἰαμβεῖον καλεῖται νῦν, ὅτι ἐν τῷ μέτρῳ τούτῳ ἰάμβιζον ἀλλήλους. καὶ ἐγένοντο τῶν παλαιῶν οἱ μὲν ἡρωικῶν οἱ δὲ ἰάμβων ποιηταί.

Ὥσπερ δὲ καὶ τὰ σπουδαῖα μάλιστα ποιητὴς Ὅμηρος ἦν \(μόνος γὰρ οὐχ ὅτι εὖ ἀλλὰ καὶ μιμήσεις δραματικὰς ἐποίησεν\), οὕτως καὶ τὸ τῆς κωμῳδίας σχῆμα πρῶτος ὑπέδειξεν, οὐ ψόγον ἀλλὰ τὸ γελοῖον δραματοποιήσας· ὁ γὰρ Μαργίτης ἀνάλογον ἔχει, ὥσπερ Ἰλιὰς καὶ ἡ Ὀδύσσεια πρὸς τὰς τραγῳδίας, οὕτω καὶ οὗτος πρὸς τὰς κωμῳδίας. παραφανείσης δὲ τῆς τραγῳδίας καὶ κωμῳδίας οἱ ἐφ᾽ ἑκατέραν τὴν ποίησιν ὁρμῶντες κατὰ τὴν οἰκείαν φύσιν οἱ μὲν ἀντὶ τῶν ἰάμβων κωμῳδοποιοὶ ἐγένοντο, οἱ δὲ ἀντὶ τῶν ἐπῶν τραγῳδοδιδάσκαλοι, διὰ τὸ μείζω καὶ ἐντιμότερα τὰ σχήματα εἶναι ταῦτα ἐκείνων.

Τὸ μὲν οὖν ἐπισκοπεῖν εἰ ἄρα ἔχει ἤδη ἡ τραγῳδία τοῖς εἴδεσιν ἱκανῶς ἢ οὔ, αὐτό τε καθ᾽ αὑτὸ κρῖναι καὶ πρὸς τὰ θέατρα, ἄλλος λόγος.

Γενομένη δ᾽ οὖν ἀπ᾽ ἀρχῆς αὐτοσχεδιαστικῆς \(καὶ αὐτὴ καὶ ἡ κωμῳδία, καὶ ἡ μὲν ἀπὸ τῶν ἐξαρχόντων τὸν διθύραμβον, ἡ δὲ ἀπὸ τῶν τὰ φαλλικὰ ἃ ἔτι καὶ νῦν ἐν πολλαῖς τῶν πόλεων διαμένει νομιζόμενα\) κατὰ μικρὸν ηὐξήθη προαγόντων ὅσον ἐγίγνετο φανερὸν αὐτῆς· καὶ πολλὰς μεταβολὰς μεταβαλοῦσα ἡ τραγῳδία ἐπαύσατο, ἐπεὶ ἔσχε τὴν αὑτῆς φύσιν.

Καὶ τό τε τῶν ὑποκριτῶν πλῆθος ἐξ ἑνὸς εἰς δύο πρῶτος Αἰσχύλος ἤγαγε καὶ τὰ τοῦ χοροῦ ἠλάττωσε καὶ τὸν λόγον πρωταγωνιστεῖν παρεσκεύασεν· τρεῖς δὲ καὶ σκηνογραφίαν Σοφοκλῆς. ἔτι δὲ τὸ μέγεθος· ἐκ μικρῶν μύθων καὶ λέξεως γελοίας διὰ τὸ ἐκ σατυρικοῦ μεταβαλεῖν ὀψὲ ἀπεσεμνύνθη, τό τε μέτρον ἐκ τετραμέτρου ἰαμβεῖον ἐγένετο. τὸ μὲν γὰρ πρῶτον τετραμέτρῳ ἐχρῶντο διὰ τὸ σατυρικὴν καὶ ὀρχηστικωτέραν εἶναι τὴν ποίησιν, λέξεως δὲ γενομένης αὐτὴ ἡ φύσις τὸ οἰκεῖον μέτρον εὗρε· μάλιστα γὰρ λεκτικὸν τῶν μέτρων τὸ ἰαμβεῖόν ἐστιν· σημεῖον δὲ τούτου, πλεῖστα γὰρ ἰαμβεῖα λέγομεν ἐν τῇ διαλέκτῳ τῇ πρὸς ἀλλήλους, ἑξάμετρα δὲ ὀλιγάκις καὶ ἐκβαίνοντες τῆς λεκτικῆς ἁρμονίας. ἔτι δὲ ἐπεισοδίων πλήθη. καὶ τὰ ἄλλ᾽ ὡς ἕκαστα κοσμηθῆναι λέγεται ἔστω ἡμῖν εἰρημένα· πολὺ γὰρ ἂν ἴσως ἔργον εἴη διεξιέναι καθ᾽ ἕκαστον.





 

5. Ἡ δὲ κωμῳδία ἐστὶν ὥσπερ εἴπομεν μίμησις φαυλοτέρων μέν, οὐ μέντοι κατὰ πᾶσαν κακίαν, ἀλλὰ τοῦ αἰσχροῦ ἐστι τὸ γελοῖον μόριον. τὸ γὰρ γελοῖόν ἐστιν ἁμάρτημά τι καὶ αἶσχος ἀνώδυνον καὶ οὐ φθαρτικόν, οἷον εὐθὺς τὸ γελοῖον πρόσωπον αἰσχρόν τι καὶ διεστραμμένον ἄνευ ὀδύνης.

Αἱ μὲν οὖν τῆς τραγῳδίας μεταβάσεις καὶ δι᾽ ὧν ἐγένοντο οὐ λελήθασιν, ἡ δὲ κωμῳδία διὰ τὸ μὴ σπουδάζεσθαι ἐξ ἀρχῆς ἔλαθεν· καὶ γὰρ χορὸν κωμῳδῶν ὀψέ ποτε ὁ ἄρχων ἔδωκεν, ἀλλ᾽ ἐθελονταὶ ἦσαν. ἤδη δὲ σχήματά τινα αὐτῆς ἐχούσης οἱ λεγόμενοι αὐτῆς ποιηταὶ μνημονεύονται. τίς δὲ πρόσωπα ἀπέδωκεν ἢ προλόγους ἢ πλήθη ὑποκριτῶν καὶ ὅσα τοιαῦτα, ἠγνόηται. τὸ δὲ μύθους ποιεῖν \[Ἐπίχαρμος καὶ Φόρμις\] τὸ μὲν ἐξ ἀρχῆς ἐκ Σικελίας ἦλθε, τῶν δὲ Ἀθήνησιν Κράτης πρῶτος ἦρξεν ἀφέμενος τῆς ἰαμβικῆς ἰδέας καθόλου ποιεῖν λόγους καὶ μύθους.

Ἡ μὲν οὖν ἐποποιία τῇ τραγῳδίᾳ μέχρι μὲν τοῦ μετὰ μέτρου λόγῳ μίμησις εἶναι σπουδαίων ἠκολούθησεν· τῷ δὲ τὸ μέτρον ἁπλοῦν ἔχειν καὶ ἀπαγγελίαν εἶναι, ταύτῃ διαφέρουσιν· ἔτι δὲ τῷ μήκει· ἡ μὲν ὅτι μάλιστα πειρᾶται ὑπὸ μίαν περίοδον ἡλίου εἶναι ἢ μικρὸν ἐξαλλάττειν, ἡ δὲ ἐποποιία ἀόριστος τῷ χρόνῳ καὶ τούτῳ διαφέρει, καίτοι τὸ πρῶτον ὁμοίως ἐν ταῖς τραγῳδίαις τοῦτο ἐποίουν καὶ ἐν τοῖς ἔπεσιν. μέρη δ᾽ ἐστὶ τὰ μὲν ταὐτά, τὰ δὲ ἴδια τῆς τραγῳδίας· διόπερ ὅστις περὶ τραγῳδίας οἶδε σπουδαίας καὶ φαύλης, οἶδε καὶ περὶ ἐπῶν· ἃ μὲν γὰρ ἐποποιία ἔχει, ὑπάρχει τῇ τραγῳδίᾳ, ἃ δὲ αὐτῇ, οὐ πάντα ἐν τῇ ἐποποιίᾳ.





 

6. Περὶ μὲν οὖν τῆς ἐν ἑξαμέτροις μιμητικῆς καὶ περὶ κωμῳδίας ὕστερον ἐροῦμεν· περὶ δὲ τραγῳδίας λέγωμεν ἀναλαβόντες αὐτῆς ἐκ τῶν εἰρημένων τὸν γινόμενον ὅρον τῆς οὐσίας.

Ἔστιν οὖν τραγῳδία μίμησις πράξεως σπουδαίας καὶ τελείας μέγεθος ἐχούσης, ἡδυσμένῳ λόγῳ χωρὶς ἑκάστῳ τῶν εἰδῶν ἐν τοῖς μορίοις, δρώντων καὶ οὐ δι᾽ ἀπαγγελίας, δι᾽ ἐλέου καὶ φόβου περαίνουσα τὴν τῶν τοιούτων παθημάτων κάθαρσιν. λέγω δὲ ἡδυσμένον μὲν λόγον τὸν ἔχοντα ῥυθμὸν καὶ ἁρμονίαν \[καὶ μέλος\], τὸ δὲ χωρὶς τοῖς εἴδεσι τὸ διὰ μέτρων ἔνια μόνον περαίνεσθαι καὶ πάλιν ἕτερα διὰ μέλους.

Ἔπεὶ δὲ πράττοντες ποιοῦνται τὴν μίμησιν, πρῶτον μὲν ἐξ ἀνάγκης ἂν εἴη τι μόριον τραγῳδίας ὁ τῆς ὄψεως κόσμος· εἶτα μελοποιία καὶ λέξις, ἐν τούτοις γὰρ ποιοῦνται τὴν μίμησιν. λέγω δὲ λέξιν μὲν αὐτὴν τὴν τῶν μέτρων σύνθεσιν, μελοποιίαν δὲ ὃ τὴν δύναμιν φανερὰν ἔχει πᾶσαν. ἐπεὶ δὲ πράξεώς ἐστι μίμησις, πράττεται δὲ ὑπὸ τινῶν πραττόντων, οὓς ἀνάγκη ποιούς τινας εἶναι κατά τε τὸ ἦθος καὶ τὴν διάνοιαν \(διὰ γὰρ τούτων καὶ τὰς πράξεις εἶναί φαμεν ποιάς τινας, \[πέφυκεν αἴτια δύο τῶν πράξεων εἶναι, διάνοια καὶ ἦθος\] καὶ κατὰ ταύτας καὶ τυγχάνουσι καὶ ἀποτυγχάνουσι πάντες\), ἔστιν δὲ τῆς μὲν πράξεως ὁ μῦθος ἡ μίμησις, λέγω γὰρ μῦθον τοῦτον τὴν σύνθεσιν τῶν πραγμάτων, τὰ δὲ ἤθη, καθ᾽ ὃ ποιούς τινας εἶναί φαμεν τοὺς πράττοντας, διάνοιαν δέ, ἐν ὅσοις λέγοντες ἀποδεικνύασίν τι ἢ καὶ ἀποφαίνονται γνώμην.

Ἀνάγκη οὖν πάσης τῆς τραγῳδίας μέρη εἶναι ἕξ, καθ᾽ ὃ ποιά τις ἐστὶν ἡ τραγῳδία· ταῦτα δ᾽ ἐστὶ μῦθος καὶ ἤθη καὶ λέξις καὶ διάνοια καὶ ὄψις καὶ μελοποιία. οἷς μὲν γὰρ μιμοῦνται, δύο μέρη ἐστίν, ὡς δὲ μιμοῦνται, ἕν, ἃ δὲ μιμοῦνται, τρία, καὶ παρὰ ταῦτα οὐδέν.

Τούτοις μὲν οὖν οὐκ ὀλίγοι αὐτῶν ὡς εἰπεῖν κέχρηνται τοῖς εἴδεσιν· καὶ γὰρ ὄψις ἔχει πᾶν καὶ ἦθος καὶ μῦθον καὶ λέξιν καὶ μέλος καὶ διάνοιαν ὡσαύτως. μέγιστον δὲ τούτων ἐστὶν ἡ τῶν πραγμάτων σύστασις. ἡ γὰρ τραγῳδία μίμησίς ἐστιν οὐκ ἀνθρώπων ἀλλὰ πράξεων καὶ βίου \[καὶ εὐδαιμονία καὶ κακοδαιμονία ἐν πράξει ἐστίν, καὶ τὸ τέλος πρᾶξίς τις ἐστίν, οὐ ποιότης· εἰσὶν δὲ κατὰ μὲν τὰ ἤθη ποιοί τινες, κατὰ δὲ τὰς πράξεις εὐδαίμονες ἢ τοὐναντίον\]· οὔκουν ὅπως τὰ ἤθη μιμήσωνται πράττουσιν, ἀλλὰ τὰ ἤθη συμπεριλαμβάνουσιν διὰ τὰς πράξεις· ὥστε τὰ πράγματα καὶ ὁ μῦθος τέλος τῆς τραγῳδίας, τὸ δὲ τέλος μέγιστον ἁπάντων.

Ἔτι ἄνευ μὲν πράξεως οὐκ ἂν γένοιτο τραγῳδία, ἄνευ δὲ ἠθῶν γέ νοιτ᾽ ἄν· αἱ γὰρ τῶν νέων τῶν πλείστων ἀήθεις τραγῳδίαι εἰσίν, καὶ ὅλως ποιηταὶ πολλοὶ τοιοῦτοι, οἷον καὶ τῶν γραφέων Ζεῦξις πρὸς Πολύγνωτον πέπονθεν· ὁ μὲν γὰρ Πολύγνωτος ἀγαθὸς ἠθογράφος, ἡ δὲ Ζεύξιδος γραφὴ οὐδὲν ἔχει ἦθος. ἔτι ἐάν τις ἐφεξῆς θῇ ῥήσεις ἠθικὰς καὶ λέξει καὶ διανοίᾳ εὖ πεποιημένας, οὐ ποιήσει ὃ ἦν τῆς τραγῳδίας ἔργον, ἀλλὰ πολὺ μᾶλλον ἡ καταδεεστέροις τούτοις κεχρημένη τραγῳδία, ἔχουσα δὲ μῦθον καὶ σύστασιν πραγμάτων. πρὸς δὲ τούτοις τὰ μέγιστα οἷς ψυχαγωγεῖ ἡ τραγῳδία τοῦ μύθου μέρη ἐστίν, αἵ τε περιπέτειαι καὶ ἀναγνωρίσεις. ἔτι σημεῖον ὅτι καὶ οἱ ἐγχειροῦντες ποιεῖν πρότερον δύνανται τῇ λέξει καὶ τοῖς ἤθεσιν ἀκριβοῦν ἢ τὰ πράγματα συνίστασθαι, οἷον καὶ οἱ πρῶτοι ποιηταὶ σχεδὸν ἅπαντες.

Ἀρχὴ μὲν οὖν καὶ οἷον ψυχὴ ὁ μῦθος τῆς τραγῳδίας, δεύτερον δὲ τὰ ἤθη \(παραπλήσιον γάρ ἐστιν καὶ ἐπὶ τῆς γραφικῆς· εἰ γάρ τις ἐναλείψειε τοῖς καλλίστοις φαρμάκοις χύδην, οὐκ ἂν ὁμοίως εὐφράνειεν καὶ λευκογραφήσας εἰκόνα\)· ἔστιν τε μίμησις πράξεως καὶ διὰ ταύτην μάλιστα τῶν πραττόντων. τρίτον δὲ ἡ διάνοια· τοῦτο δέ ἐστιν τὸ λέγειν δύνασθαι τὰ ἐνόντα καὶ τὰ ἁρμόττοντα, ὅπερ ἐπὶ τῶν λόγων τῆς πολιτικῆς καὶ ῥητορικῆς ἔργον ἐστίν· οἱ μὲν γὰρ ἀρχαῖοι πολιτικῶς ἐποίουν λέγοντας, οἱ δὲ νῦν ῥητορικῶς. ἔστιν δὲ ἦθος μὲν τὸ τοιοῦτον ὃ δηλοῖ τὴν προαίρεσιν, ὁποία τις \[ἐν οἷς οὐκ ἔστι δῆλον ἢ προαιρεῖται ἢ φεύγει\] διόπερ οὐκ ἔχουσιν ἦθος τῶν λόγων ἐν οἷς μηδ᾽ ὅλως ἔστιν ὅ τι προαιρεῖται ἢ φεύγει ὁ λέγων διάνοια δὲ ἐν οἷς ἀποδεικνύουσί τι ὡς ἔστιν ἢ ὡς οὐκ ἔστιν ἢ καθόλου τι ἀποφαίνονται. τέταρτον δὲ τῶν μὲν λόγων ἡ λέξις· λέγω δέ, ὥσπερ πρότερον εἴρηται, λέξιν εἶναι τὴν διὰ τῆς ὀνομασίας ἑρμηνείαν, ὃ καὶ ἐπὶ τῶν ἐμμέτρων καὶ ἐπὶ τῶν λόγων ἔχει τὴν αὐτὴν δύναμιν.

Τῶν δὲ λοιπῶν ἡ μελοποιία μέγιστον τῶν ἡδυσμάτων, ἡ δὲ ὄψις ψυχαγωγικὸν μέν, ἀτεχνότατον δὲ καὶ ἥκιστα οἰκεῖον τῆς ποιητικῆς· ἡ γὰρ τῆς τραγῳδίας δύναμις καὶ ἄνευ ἀγῶνος καὶ ὑποκριτῶν ἔστιν, ἔτι δὲ κυριωτέρα περὶ τὴν ἀπεργασίαν τῶν ὄψεων ἡ τοῦ σκευοποιοῦ τέχνη τῆς τῶν ποιητῶν ἐστιν.





 

7. Διωρισμένων δὲ τούτων, λέγωμεν μετὰ ταῦτα ποίαν τινὰ δεῖ τὴν σύστασιν εἶναι τῶν πραγμάτων, ἐπειδὴ τοῦτο καὶ πρῶτον καὶ μέγιστον τῆς τραγῳδίας ἐστίν. κεῖται δὴ ἡμῖν τὴν τραγῳδίαν τελείας καὶ ὅλης πράξεως εἶναι μίμησιν ἐχούσης τι μέγεθος· ἔστιν γὰρ ὅλον καὶ μηδὲν ἔχον μέγεθος. ὅλον δέ ἐστιν τὸ ἔχον ἀρχὴν καὶ μέσον καὶ τελευτήν. ἀρχὴ δέ ἐστιν ὃ αὐτὸ μὲν μὴ ἐξ ἀνάγκης μετ᾽ ἄλλο ἐστίν, μετ᾽ ἐκεῖνο δ᾽ ἕτερον πέφυκεν εἶναι ἢ γίνεσθαι· τελευτὴ δὲ τοὐναντίον ὃ αὐτὸ μὲν μετ᾽ ἄλλο πέφυκεν εἶναι ἢ ἐξ ἀνάγκης ἢ ὡς ἐπὶ τὸ πολύ, μετὰ δὲ τοῦτο ἄλλο οὐδέν· μέσον δὲ ὃ καὶ αὐτὸ μετ᾽ ἄλλο καὶ μετ᾽ ἐκεῖνο ἕτερον. δεῖ ἄρα τοὺς συνεστῶτας εὖ μύθους μήθ᾽ ὁπόθεν ἔτυχεν ἄρχεσθαι μήθ᾽ ὅπου ἔτυχε τελευτᾶν, ἀλλὰ κεχρῆσθαι ταῖς εἰρημέναις ἰδέαις.

Ἔτι δ᾽ ἐπεὶ τὸ καλὸν καὶ ζῷον καὶ ἅπαν πρᾶγμα ὃ συνέστηκεν ἐκ τινῶν οὐ μόνον ταῦτα τεταγμένα δεῖ ἔχειν ἀλλὰ καὶ μέγεθος ὑπάρχειν μὴ τὸ τυχόν· τὸ γὰρ καλὸν ἐν μεγέθει καὶ τάξει ἐστίν, διὸ οὔτε πάμμικρον ἄν τι γένοιτο καλὸν ζῷον \(συγχεῖται γὰρ ἡ θεωρία ἐγγὺς τοῦ ἀναισθήτου χρόνου γινομένη\) οὔτε παμμέγεθες \(οὐ γὰρ ἅμα ἡ θεωρία γίνεται ἀλλ᾽ οἴχεται τοῖς θεωροῦσι τὸ ἓν καὶ τὸ ὅλον ἐκ τῆς θεωρίας\) οἷον εἰ μυρίων σταδίων εἴη ζῷον· ὥστε δεῖ καθάπερ ἐπὶ τῶν σωμάτων καὶ ἐπὶ τῶν ζῴων ἔχειν μὲν μέγεθος, τοῦτο δὲ εὐσύνοπτον εἶναι, οὕτω καὶ ἐπὶ τῶν μύθων ἔχειν μὲν μῆκος, τοῦτο δὲ εὐμνημόνευτον εἶναι.

Τοῦ δὲ μήκους ὅρος <ὁ> μὲν πρὸς τοὺς ἀγῶνας καὶ τὴν αἴσθησιν οὐ τῆς τέχνης ἐστίν· εἰ γὰρ ἔδει ἑκατὸν τραγῳδίας ἀγωνίζεσθαι, πρὸς κλεψύδρας ἂν ἠγωνίζοντο, ὥσπερ ποτὲ καὶ ἄλλοτέ φασιν. ὁ δὲ κατ᾽ αὐτὴν τὴν φύσιν τοῦ πράγματος ὅρος, ἀεὶ μὲν ὁ μείζων μέχρι τοῦ σύνδηλος εἶναι καλλίων ἐστὶ κατὰ τὸ μέγεθος· ὡς δὲ ἁπλῶς διορίσαντας εἰπεῖν, ἐν ὅσῳ μεγέθει κατὰ τὸ εἰκὸς ἢ τὸ ἀναγκαῖον ἐφεξῆς γιγνομένων συμβαίνει εἰς εὐτυχίαν ἐκ δυστυχίας ἢ ἐξ εὐτυχίας εἰς δυστυχίαν μεταβάλλειν, ἱκανὸς ὅρος ἐστὶν τοῦ μεγέθους.





 

8. Μῦθος δ᾽ ἐστὶν εἷς οὐχ ὥσπερ τινὲς οἴονται ἐὰν περὶ ἕνα ᾖ· πολλὰ γὰρ καὶ ἄπειρα τῷ ἑνὶ συμβαίνει, ἐξ ὧν ἐνίων οὐδέν ἐστιν ἕν· οὕτως δὲ καὶ πράξεις ἑνὸς πολλαί εἰσιν, ἐξ ὧν μία οὐδεμία γίνεται πρᾶξις. διὸ πάντες ἐοίκασιν ἁμαρτάνειν ὅσοι τῶν ποιητῶν Ἡρακληίδα Θησηίδα καὶ τὰ τοιαῦτα ποιήματα πεποιήκασιν· οἴονται γάρ, ἐπεὶ εἷς ἦν ὁ Ἡρακλῆς, ἕνα καὶ τὸν μῦθον εἶναι προσήκειν. ὁ δ᾽ Ὅμηρος ὥσπερ καὶ τὰ ἄλλα διαφέρει καὶ τοῦτ᾽ ἔοικεν καλῶς ἰδεῖν, ἤτοι διὰ τέχνην ἢ διὰ φύσιν· Ὀδύσσειαν γὰρ ποιῶν οὐκ ἐποίησεν ἅπαντα ὅσα αὐτῷ συνέβη, οἷον πληγῆναι μὲν ἐν τῷ Παρνασσῷ, μανῆναι δὲ προσποιήσασθαι ἐν τῷ ἀγερμῷ, ὧν οὐδὲν θατέρου γενομένου ἀναγκαῖον ἦν ἢ εἰκὸς θάτερον γενέσθαι, ἀλλὰ περὶ μίαν πρᾶξιν οἵαν λέγομεν τὴν Ὀδύσσειαν συνέστησεν, ὁμοίως δὲ καὶ τὴν Ἰλιάδα.

Χρὴ οὖν, καθάπερ καὶ ἐν ταῖς ἄλλαις μιμητικαῖς ἡ μία μίμησις ἑνός ἐστιν, οὕτω καὶ τὸν μῦθον, ἐπεὶ πράξεως μίμησίς ἐστι, μιᾶς τε εἶναι καὶ ταύτης ὅλης, καὶ τὰ μέρη συνεστάναι τῶν πραγμάτων οὕτως ὥστε μετατιθεμένου τινὸς μέρους ἢ ἀφαιρουμένου διαφέρεσθαι καὶ κινεῖσθαι τὸ ὅλον· ὃ γὰρ προσὸν ἢ μὴ προσὸν μηδὲν ποιεῖ ἐπίδηλον, οὐδὲν μόριον τοῦ ὅλου ἐστίν.





 

9. Φανερὸν δὲ ἐκ τῶν εἰρημένων καὶ ὅτι οὐ τὸ τὰ γενόμενα λέγειν, τοῦτο ποιητοῦ ἔργον ἐστίν, ἀλλ᾽ οἷα ἂν γένοιτο καὶ τὰ δυνατὰ κατὰ τὸ εἰκὸς ἢ τὸ ἀναγκαῖον. ὁ γὰρ ἱστορικὸς καὶ ὁ ποιητὴς οὐ τῷ ἢ ἔμμετρα λέγειν ἢ ἄμετρα διαφέρουσιν \(εἴη γὰρ ἂν τὰ Ἡροδότου εἰς μέτρα τεθῆναι καὶ οὐδὲν ἧττον ἂν εἴη ἱστορία τις μετὰ μέτρου ἢ ἄνευ μέτρων\)· ἀλλὰ τούτῳ διαφέρει, τῷ τὸν μὲν τὰ γενόμενα λέγειν, τὸν δὲ οἷα ἂν γένοιτο. διὸ καὶ φιλοσοφώτερον καὶ σπουδαιότερον ποίησις ἱστορίας ἐστίν· ἡ μὲν γὰρ ποίησις μᾶλλον τὰ καθόλου, ἡ δ᾽ ἱστορία τὰ καθ᾽ ἕκαστον λέγει. ἔστιν δὲ καθόλου μέν, τῷ ποίῳ τὰ ποῖα ἄττα συμβαίνει λέγειν ἢ πράττειν κατὰ τὸ εἰκὸς ἢ τὸ ἀναγκαῖον, οὗ στοχάζεται ἡ ποίησις ὀνόματα ἐπιτιθεμένη· τὸ δὲ καθ᾽ ἕκαστον, τί Ἀλκιβιάδης ἔπραξεν ἢ τί ἔπαθεν.

Ἐπὶ μὲν οὖν τῆς κωμῳδίας ἤδη τοῦτο δῆλον γέγονεν· συστήσαντες γὰρ τὸν μῦθον διὰ τῶν εἰκότων οὕτω τὰ τυχόντα ὀνόματα ὑποτιθέασιν, καὶ οὐχ ὥσπερ οἱ ἰαμβοποιοὶ περὶ τὸν καθ᾽ ἕκαστον ποιοῦσιν. ἐπὶ δὲ τῆς τραγῳδίας τῶν γενομένων ὀνομάτων ἀντέχονται. αἴτιον δ᾽ ὅτι πιθανόν ἐστι τὸ δυνατόν· τὰ μὲν οὖν μὴ γενόμενα οὔπω πιστεύομεν εἶναι δυνατά, τὰ δὲ γενόμενα φανερὸν ὅτι δυνατά· οὐ γὰρ ἂν ἐγένετο, εἰ ἦν ἀδύνατα. οὐ μὴν ἀλλὰ καὶ ἐν ταῖς τραγῳδίαις ἐν ἐνίαις μὲν ἓν ἢ δύο τῶν γνωρίμων ἐστὶν ὀνομάτων, τὰ δὲ ἄλλα πεποιημένα, ἐν ἐνίαις δὲ οὐθέν, οἷον ἐν τῷ Ἀγάθωνος Ἀνθεῖ· ὁμοίως γὰρ ἐν τούτῳ τά τε πράγματα καὶ τὰ ὀνόματα πεποίηται, καὶ οὐδὲν ἧττον εὐφραίνει. ὥστ᾽ οὐ πάντως εἶναι ζητητέον τῶν παραδεδομένων μύθων, περὶ οὓς αἱ τραγῳδίαι εἰσίν, ἀντέχεσθαι. καὶ γὰρ γελοῖον τοῦτο ζητεῖν, ἐπεὶ καὶ τὰ γνώριμα ὀλίγοις γνώριμά ἐστιν, ἀλλ᾽ ὅμως εὐφραίνει πάντας.

Δῆλον οὖν ἐκ τούτων ὅτι τὸν ποιητὴν μᾶλλον τῶν μύθων εἶναι δεῖ ποιητὴν ἢ τῶν μέτρων, ὅσῳ ποιητὴς κατὰ τὴν μίμησίν ἐστιν, μιμεῖται δὲ τὰς πράξεις. κἂν ἄρα συμβῇ γενόμενα ποιεῖν, οὐθὲν ἧττον ποιητής ἐστι· τῶν γὰρ γενομένων ἔνια οὐδὲν κωλύει τοιαῦτα εἶναι οἷα ἂν εἰκὸς γενέσθαι καὶ δυνατὰ γενέσθαι, καθ᾽ ὃ ἐκεῖνος αὐτῶν ποιητής ἐστιν.

Τῶν δὲ ἁπλῶν μύθων καὶ πράξεων αἱ ἐπεισοδιώδεις εἰσὶν χείρισται· λέγω δ᾽ ἐπεισοδιώδη μῦθον ἐν ᾧ τὰ ἐπεισόδια μετ᾽ ἄλληλα οὔτ᾽ εἰκὸς οὔτ᾽ ἀνάγκη εἶναι. τοιαῦται δὲ ποιοῦνται ὑπὸ μὲν τῶν φαύλων ποιητῶν δι᾽ αὐτούς, ὑπὸ δὲ τῶν ἀγαθῶν διὰ τοὺς ὑποκριτάς· ἀγωνίσματα γὰρ ποιοῦντες καὶ παρὰ τὴν δύναμιν παρατείνοντες τὸν μῦθον πολλάκις διαστρέφειν ἀναγκάζονται τὸ ἐφεξῆς.

Ἐπεὶ δὲ οὐ μόνον τελείας ἐστὶ πράξεως ἡ μίμησις ἀλλὰ καὶ φοβερῶν καὶ ἐλεεινῶν, ταῦτα δὲ γίνεται καὶ μάλιστα \[καὶ μᾶλλον\] ὅταν γένηται παρὰ τὴν δόξαν δι᾽ ἄλληλα· τὸ γὰρ θαυμαστὸν οὕτως ἕξει μᾶλλον ἢ εἰ ἀπὸ τοῦ αὐτομάτου καὶ τῆς τύχης, ἐπεὶ καὶ τῶν ἀπὸ τύχης ταῦτα θαυμασιώτατα δοκεῖ ὅσα ὥσπερ ἐπίτηδες φαίνεται γεγονέναι, οἷον ὡς ὁ ἀνδριὰς ὁ τοῦ Μίτυος ἐν Ἄργει ἀπέκτεινεν τὸν αἴτιον τοῦ θανάτου τῷ Μίτυι, θεωροῦντι ἐμπεσών· ἔοικε γὰρ τὰ τοιαῦτα οὐκ εἰκῇ γίνεσθαι· ὥστε ἀνάγκη τοὺς τοιούτους εἶναι καλλίους μύθους.

 

10. Εἰσὶ δὲ τῶν μύθων οἱ μὲν ἁπλοῖ οἱ δὲ πεπλεγμένοι· καὶ γὰρ αἱ πράξεις ὧν μιμήσεις οἱ μῦθοί εἰσιν ὑπάρχουσιν εὐθὺς οὖσαι τοιαῦται. λέγω δὲ ἁπλῆν μὲν πρᾶξιν ἧς γινομένης ὥσπερ ὥρισται συνεχοῦς καὶ μιᾶς ἄνευ περιπετείας ἢ ἀναγνωρισμοῦ ἡ μετάβασις γίνεται, πεπλεγμένην δὲ ἐξ ἧς μετὰ ἀναγνωρισμοῦ ἢ περιπετείας ἢ ἀμφοῖν ἡ μετάβασίς ἐστιν.

Ταῦτα δὲ δεῖ γίνεσθαι ἐξ αὐτῆς τῆς συστάσεως τοῦ μύθου, ὥστε ἐκ τῶν προγεγενημένων συμβαίνειν ἢ ἐξ ἀνάγκης ἢ κατὰ τὸ εἰκὸς γίγνεσθαι ταῦτα· διαφέρει γὰρ πολὺ τὸ γίγνεσθαι τάδε διὰ τάδε ἢ μετὰ τάδε.





 

11. Ἔστι δὲ περιπέτεια μὲν ἡ εἰς τὸ ἐναντίον τῶν πραττομένων μεταβολὴ καθάπερ εἴρηται, καὶ τοῦτο δὲ ὥσπερ λέγομεν κατὰ τὸ εἰκὸς ἢ ἀναγκαῖον, οἷον ἐν τῷ Οἰδιποδι ἐλθὼν ὡς εὐφρανῶν τὸν Οἰδίπουν καὶ ἀπαλλάξων τοῦ πρὸς τὴν μητέρα φόβου, δηλώσας ὃς ἦν, τοὐναντίον ἐποίησεν· καὶ ἐν τῷ Λυγκεῖ ὁ μὲν ἀγόμενος ὡς ἀποθανούμενος, ὁ δὲ Δαναὸς ἀκολουθῶν ὡς ἀποκτενῶν, τὸν μὲν συνέβη ἐκ τῶν πεπραγμένων ἀποθανεῖν, τὸν δὲ σωθῆναι.

Ἀναγνώρισις δέ, ὥσπερ καὶ τοὔνομα σημαίνει, ἐξ ἀγνοίας εἰς γνῶσιν μεταβολή, ἢ εἰς φιλίαν ἢ εἰς ἔχθραν, τῶν πρὸς εὐτυχίαν ἢ δυστυχίαν ὡρισμένων· καλλίστη δὲ ἀναγνώρισις, ὅταν ἅμα περιπετείᾳ γένηται, οἷον ἔχει ἡ ἐν τῷ Οἰδίποδι.

Εἰσὶν μὲν οὖν καὶ ἄλλαι ἀναγνωρίσεις· καὶ γὰρ πρὸς ἄψυχα καὶ τὰ τυχόντα ἐστὶν ὥς<ὃ> περ εἴρηται συμβαίνει, καὶ εἰ πέπραγέ τις ἢ μὴ πέπραγεν ἔστιν ἀναγνωρίσαι. Ἀλλ᾽ ἡ μάλιστα τοῦ μύθου καὶ ἡ μάλιστα τῆς πράξεως ἡ εἰρημένη ἐστίν· ἡ γὰρ τοιαύτη ἀναγνώρισις καὶ περιπέτεια ἢ ἔλεον ἕξει ἢ φόβον \(οἵων πράξεων ἡ τραγῳδία μίμησις ὑπόκειται\), ἐπειδὴ καὶ τὸ ἀτυχεῖν καὶ τὸ εὐτυχεῖν ἐπὶ τῶν τοιούτων συμβήσεται.

Ἐπεὶ δὴ ἡ ἀναγνώρισις τινῶν ἐστιν ἀναγνώρισις, αἱ μέν εἰσι θατέρου πρὸς τὸν ἕτερον μόνον, ὅταν ᾖ δῆλος ἅτερος τίς ἐστιν, ὁτὲ δὲ ἀμφοτέρους δεῖ ἀναγνωρίσαι, οἷον ἡ μὲν Ἰφιγένεια τῷ Ὀρέστῃ ἀνεγνωρίσθη ἐκ τῆς πέμψεως τῆς ἐπιστολῆς, ἐκείνου δὲ πρὸς τὴν Ἰφιγένειαν ἄλλης ἔδει ἀναγνωρίσεως.

Δύο μὲν οὖν τοῦ μύθου μέρη ταῦτ᾽ ἐστί, περιπέτεια καὶ ἀναγνώρισις· τρίτον δὲ πάθος. τούτων δὲ περιπέτεια μὲν καὶ ἀναγνώρισις εἴρηται, πάθος δέ ἐστι πρᾶξις φθαρτικὴ ἢ ὀδυνηρά, οἷον οἵ τε ἐν τῷ φανερῷ θάνατοι καὶ αἱ περιωδυνίαι καὶ τρώσεις καὶ ὅσα τοιαῦτα.

12. Μέρη δὲ τραγῳδίας οἷς μὲν ὡς εἴδεσι δεῖ χρῆσθαι πρότερον εἴπομεν, κατὰ δὲ τὸ ποσὸν καὶ εἰς ἃ διαιρεῖται κεχωρισμένα τάδε ἐστίν, πρόλογος ἐπεισόδιον ἔξοδος χορικόν, καὶ τούτου τὸ μὲν πάροδος τὸ δὲ στάσιμον, κοινὰ μὲν ἁπάντων ταῦτα, ἴδια δὲ τὰ ἀπὸ τῆς σκηνῆς καὶ κομμοί.

Ἔστιν δὲ πρόλογος μὲν μέρος ὅλον τραγῳδίας τὸ πρὸ χοροῦ παρόδου, ἐπεισόδιον δὲ μέρος ὅλον τραγῳδίας τὸ μεταξὺ ὅλων χορικῶν μελῶν, ἔξοδος δὲ μέρος ὅλον τραγῳδίας μεθ᾽ ὃ οὐκ ἔστι χοροῦ μέλος· χορικοῦ δὲ πάροδος μὲν ἡ πρώτη λέξις ὅλη χοροῦ, στάσιμον δὲ μέλος χοροῦ τὸ ἄνευ ἀναπαίστου καὶ τροχαίου, κομμὸς δὲ θρῆνος κοινὸς χοροῦ καὶ ἀπὸ σκηνῆς.

Μέρη δὲ τραγῳδίας οἷς μὲν <ὡς εἴδεσι> δεῖ χρῆσθαι πρότερον εἴπαμεν, κατὰ δὲ τὸ ποσὸν καὶ εἰς ἃ διαιρεῖται κεχωρισμένα ταῦτ᾽ ἐστίν.





 

13. Ὧν δὲ δεῖ στοχάζεσθαι καὶ ἃ δεῖ εὐλαβεῖσθαι συνιστάντας τοὺς μύθους καὶ πόθεν ἔσται τὸ τῆς τραγῳδίας ἔργον, ἐφεξῆς ἂν εἴη λεκτέον τοῖς νῦν εἰρημένοις.

Ἐπειδὴ οὖν δεῖ τὴν σύνθεσιν εἶναι τῆς καλλίστης τραγῳδίας μὴ ἁπλῆν ἀλλὰ πεπλεγμένην καὶ ταύτην φοβερῶν καὶ ἐλεεινῶν εἶναι μιμητικήν \(τοῦτο γὰρ ἴδιον τῆς τοιαύτης μιμήσεώς ἐστιν\), πρῶτον μὲν δῆλον ὅτι οὔτε τοὺς ἐπιεικεῖς ἄνδρας δεῖ μεταβάλλοντας φαίνεσθαι ἐξ εὐτυχίας εἰς δυστυχίαν, οὐ γὰρ φοβερὸν οὐδὲ ἐλεεινὸν τοῦτο ἀλλὰ μιαρόν ἐστιν· οὔτε τοὺς μοχθηροὺς ἐξ ἀτυχίας εἰς εὐτυχίαν, ἀτραγῳδότατον γὰρ τοῦτ᾽ ἐστὶ πάντων, οὐδὲν γὰρ ἔχει ὧν δεῖ, οὔτε γὰρ φιλάνθρωπον οὔτε ἐλεεινὸν οὔτε φοβερόν ἐστιν· οὐδ᾽ αὖ τὸν σφόδρα πονηρὸν ἐξ εὐτυχίας εἰς δυστυχίαν μεταπίπτειν· τὸ μὲν γὰρ φιλάνθρωπον ἔχοι ἂν ἡ τοιαύτη σύστασις ἀλλ᾽ οὔτε ἔλεον οὔτε φόβον, ὁ μὲν γὰρ περὶ τὸν ἀνάξιόν ἐστιν δυστυχοῦντα, ὁ δὲ περὶ τὸν ὅμοιον, ἔλεος μὲν περὶ τὸν ἀνάξιον, φόβος δὲ περὶ τὸν ὅμοιον, ὥστε οὔτε ἐλεεινὸν οὔτε φοβερὸν ἔσται τὸ συμβαῖνον. ὁ μεταξὺ ἄρα τούτων λοιπός. ἔστι δὲ τοιοῦτος ὁ μήτε ἀρετῇ διαφέρων καὶ δικαιοσύνῃ μήτε διὰ κακίαν καὶ μοχθηρίαν μεταβάλλων εἰς τὴν δυστυχίαν ἀλλὰ δι᾽ ἁμαρτίαν τινά, τῶν ἐν μεγάλῃ δόξῃ ὄντων καὶ εὐτυχίᾳ, οἷον Οἰδίπους καὶ Θυέστης καὶ οἱ ἐκ τῶν τοιούτων γενῶν ἐπιφανεῖς ἄνδρες.

Ἀνάγκη ἄρα τὸν καλῶς ἔχοντα μῦθον ἁπλοῦν εἶναι μᾶλλον ἢ διπλοῦν, ὥσπερ τινές φασι, καὶ μεταβάλλειν οὐκ εἰς εὐτυχίαν ἐκ δυστυχίας ἀλλὰ τοὐναντίον ἐξ εὐτυχίας εἰς δυστυχίαν μὴ διὰ μοχθηρίαν ἀλλὰ δι᾽ ἁμαρτίαν μεγάλην ἢ οἵου εἴρηται ἢ βελτίονος μᾶλλον ἢ χείρονος. Σημεῖον δὲ καὶ τὸ γιγνόμενον· πρῶτον μὲν γὰρ οἱ ποιηταὶ τοὺς τυχόντας μύθους ἀπηρίθμουν, νῦν δὲ περὶ ὀλίγας οἰκίας αἱ κάλλισται τραγῳδίαι συντίθενται, οἷον περὶ Ἀλκμέωνα καὶ Οἰδίπουν καὶ Ὀρέστην καὶ Μελέαγρον καὶ Θυέστην καὶ Τήλεφον καὶ ὅσοις ἄλλοις συμβέβηκεν ἢ παθεῖν δεινὰ ἢ ποιῆσαι.

Ἡ μὲν οὖν κατὰ τὴν τέχνην καλλίστη τραγῳδία ἐκ ταύτης τῆς συστάσεώς ἐστι. διὸ καὶ οἱ Εὐριπίδῃ ἐγκαλοῦντες τὸ αὐτὸ ἁμαρτάνουσιν ὅτι τοῦτο δρᾷ ἐν ταῖς τραγῳδίαις καὶ αἱ πολλαὶ αὐτοῦ εἰς δυστυχίαν τελευτῶσιν. τοῦτο γάρ ἐστιν ὥσπερ εἴρηται ὀρθόν· σημεῖον δὲ μέγιστον· ἐπὶ γὰρ τῶν σκηνῶν καὶ τῶν ἀγώνων τραγικώταται αἱ τοιαῦται φαίνονται, ἂν κατορθωθῶσιν, καὶ ὁ Εὐριπίδης, εἰ καὶ τὰ ἄλλα μὴ εὖ οἰκονομεῖ, ἀλλὰ τραγικώτατός γε τῶν ποιητῶν φαίνεται.

Δευτέρα δ᾽ ἡ πρώτη λεγομένη ὑπὸ τινῶν ἐστιν σύστασις, ἡ διπλῆν τε τὴν σύστασιν ἔχουσα καθάπερ ἡ Ὀδύσσεια καὶ τελευτῶσα ἐξ ἐναντίας τοῖς βελτίοσι καὶ χείροσιν. δοκεῖ δὲ εἶναι πρώτη διὰ τὴν τῶν θεάτρων ἀσθένειαν· ἀκολουθοῦσι γὰρ οἱ ποιηταὶ κατ᾽ εὐχὴν ποιοῦντες τοῖς θεαταῖς. ἔστιν δὲ οὐχ αὕτη ἀπὸ τραγῳδίας ἡδονὴ ἀλλὰ μᾶλλον τῆς κωμῳδίας οἰκεία· ἐκεῖ γὰρ οἳ ἂν ἔχθιστοι ὦσιν ἐν τῷ μύθῳ, οἷον Ὀρέστης καὶ Αἴγισθος, φίλοι γενόμενοι ἐπὶ τελευτῆς ἐξέρχονται, καὶ ἀποθνῄσκει οὐδεὶς ὑπ᾽ οὐδενός.



 

14. Ἔστιν μὲν οὖν τὸ φοβερὸν καὶ ἐλεεινὸν ἐκ τῆς ὄψεως γίγνεσθαι, ἔστιν δὲ καὶ ἐξ αὐτῆς τῆς συστάσεως τῶν πραγμάτων, ὅπερ ἐστὶ πρότερον καὶ ποιητοῦ ἀμείνονος. δεῖ γὰρ καὶ ἄνευ τοῦ ὁρᾶν οὕτω συνεστάναι τὸν μῦθον ὥστε τὸν ἀκούοντα τὰ πράγματα γινόμενα καὶ φρίττειν καὶ ἐλεεῖν ἐκ τῶν συμβαινόντων· ἅπερ ἂν πάθοι τις ἀκούων τὸν τοῦ Οἰδίπου μῦθον. τὸ δὲ διὰ τῆς ὄψεως τοῦτο παρασκευάζειν ἀτεχνότερον καὶ χορηγίας δεόμενόν ἐστιν.

Οἱ δὲ μὴ τὸ φοβερὸν διὰ τῆς ὄψεως ἀλλὰ τὸ τερατῶδες μόνον παρασκευάζοντες οὐδὲν τραγῳδίᾳ κοινωνοῦσιν· οὐ γὰρ πᾶσαν δεῖ ζητεῖν ἡδονὴν ἀπὸ τραγῳδίας ἀλλὰ τὴν οἰκείαν. ἐπεὶ δὲ τὴν ἀπὸ ἐλέου καὶ φόβου διὰ μιμήσεως δεῖ ἡδονὴν παρασκευάζειν τὸν ποιητήν, φανερὸν ὡς τοῦτο ἐν τοῖς πράγμασιν ἐμποιητέον. ποῖα οὖν δεινὰ ἢ ποῖα οἰκτρὰ φαίνεται τῶν συμπιπτόντων, λάβωμεν.

Ἀνάγκη δὴ ἢ φίλων εἶναι πρὸς ἀλλήλους τὰς τοιαύτας πράξεις ἢ ἐχθρῶν ἢ μηδετέρων. ἂν μὲν οὖν ἐχθρὸς ἐχθρόν, οὐδὲν ἐλεεινὸν οὔτε ποιῶν οὔτε μέλλων, πλὴν κατ᾽ αὐτὸ τὸ πάθος· οὐδ᾽ ἂν μηδετέρως ἔχοντες· ὅταν δ᾽ ἐν ταῖς φιλίαις ἐγγένηται τὰ πάθη, οἷον ἢ ἀδελφὸς ἀδελφὸν ἢ υἱὸς πατέρα ἢ μήτηρ υἱὸν ἢ υἱὸς μητέρα ἀποκτείνῃ ἢ μέλλῃ ἤ τι ἄλλο τοιοῦτον δρᾷ, ταῦτα ζητητέον. τοὺς μὲν οὖν παρειλημμένους μύθους λύειν οὐκ ἔστιν, λέγω δὲ οἷον τὴν Κλυταιμήστραν ἀποθανοῦσαν ὑπὸ τοῦ Ὀρέστου καὶ τὴν Ἐριφύλην ὑπὸ τοῦ Ἀλκμέωνος, αὐτὸν δὲ εὑρίσκειν δεῖ καὶ τοῖς παραδεδομένοις χρῆσθαι καλῶς. τὸ δὲ καλῶς τί λέγομεν, εἴπωμεν σαφέστερον.

Ἔστι μὲν γὰρ οὕτω γίνεσθαι τὴν πρᾶξιν, ὥσπερ οἱ παλαιοὶ ἐποίουν εἰδότας καὶ γιγνώσκοντας, καθάπερ καὶ Εὐριπίδης ἐποίησεν ἀποκτείνουσαν τοὺς παῖδας τὴν Μήδειαν· ἔστιν δὲ πρᾶξαι μέν, ἀγνοοῦντας δὲ πρᾶξαι τὸ δεινόν, εἶθ᾽ ὕστερον ἀναγνωρίσαι τὴν φιλίαν, ὥσπερ ὁ Σοφοκλέους Οἰδίπους· τοῦτο μὲν οὖν ἔξω τοῦ δράματος, ἐν δ᾽ αὐτῇ τῇ τραγῳδίᾳ οἷον ὁ Ἀλκμέων ὁ Ἀστυδάμαντος ἢ ὁ Τηλέγονος ὁ ἐν τῷ τραυματίᾳ Ὀδυσσεῖ.

Ἔτι δὲ τρίτον παρὰ ταῦτα τὸ μέλλοντα ποιεῖν τι τῶν ἀνηκέστων δι᾽ ἄγνοιαν ἀναγνωρίσαι πρὶν ποιῆσαι. καὶ παρὰ ταῦτα οὐκ ἔστιν ἄλλως. ἢ γὰρ πρᾶξαι ἀνάγκη ἢ μὴ καὶ εἰδότας ἢ μὴ εἰδότας. τούτων δὲ τὸ μὲν γινώσκοντα μελλῆσαι καὶ μὴ πρᾶξαι χείριστον· τό τε γὰρ μιαρὸν ἔχει, καὶ οὐ τραγικόν· ἀπαθὲς γάρ. διόπερ οὐδεὶς ποιεῖ ὁμοίως, εἰ μὴ ὀλιγάκις, οἷον ἐν Ἀντιγόνῃ τὸν Κρέοντα ὁ Αἵμων. τὸ δὲ πρᾶξαι δεύτερον. βέλτιον δὲ τὸ ἀγνοοῦντα μὲν πρᾶξαι, πράξαντα δὲ ἀναγνωρίσαι· τό τε γὰρ μιαρὸν οὐ πρόσεστιν καὶ ἡ ἀναγνώρισις ἐκπληκτικόν.

Κράτιστον δὲ τὸ τελευταῖον, λέγω δὲ οἷον ἐν τῷ Κρεσφόντῃ ἡ Μερόπη μέλλει τὸν υἱὸν ἀποκτείνειν, ἀποκτείνει δὲ οὔ, ἀλλ᾽ ἀνεγνώρισε, καὶ ἐν τῇ Ἰφιγενείᾳ ἡ ἀδελφὴ τὸν ἀδελφόν, καὶ ἐν τῇ Ἕλλῃ ὁ υἱὸς τὴν μητέρα ἐκδιδόναι μέλλων ἀνεγνώρισεν. διὰ γὰρ τοῦτο, ὅπερ πάλαι εἴρηται, οὐ περὶ πολλὰ γένη αἱ τραγῳδίαι εἰσίν. ζητοῦντες γὰρ οὐκ ἀπὸ τέχνης ἀλλ᾽ ἀπὸ τύχης εὗρον τὸ τοιοῦτον παρασκευάζειν ἐν τοῖς μύθοις· ἀναγκάζονται οὖν ἐπὶ ταύτας τὰς οἰκίας ἀπαντᾶν ὅσαις τὰ τοιαῦτα συμβέβηκε πάθη.

Περὶ μὲν οὖν τῆς τῶν πραγμάτων συστάσεως καὶ ποίους τινὰς εἶναι δεῖ τοὺς μύθους εἴρηται ἱκανῶς.





 

15. Περὶ δὲ τὰ ἤθη τέτταρά ἐστιν ὧν δεῖ στοχάζεσθαι, ἓν μὲν καὶ πρῶτον, ὅπως χρηστὰ ᾖ. ἕξει δὲ ἦθος μὲν ἐὰν ὥσπερ ἐλέχθη ποιῇ φανερὸν ὁ λόγος ἢ ἡ πρᾶξις προαίρεσίν τινα <ἥ τις ἂν> ᾖ, χρηστὸν δὲ ἐὰν χρηστήν. ἔστιν δὲ ἐν ἑκάστῳ γένει· καὶ γὰρ γυνή ἐστιν χρηστὴ καὶ δοῦλος, καίτοι γε ἴσως τούτων τὸ μὲν χεῖρον, τὸ δὲ ὅλως φαῦλόν ἐστιν. δεύτερον δὲ τὸ ἁρμόττοντα· ἔστιν γὰρ ἀνδρείαν μὲν τὸ ἦθος, ἀλλ᾽ οὐχ ἁρμόττον γυναικὶ οὕτως ἀνδρείαν ἢ δεινὴν εἶναι. τρίτον δὲ τὸ ὅμοιον. τοῦτο γὰρ ἕτερον τοῦ χρηστὸν τὸ ἦθος καὶ ἁρμόττον ποιῆσαι ὡς προείρηται. τέταρτον δὲ τὸ ὁμαλόν. κἂν γὰρ ἀνώμαλός τις ᾖ ὁ τὴν μίμησιν παρέχων καὶ τοιοῦτον ἦθος ὑποτεθῇ, ὅμως ὁμαλῶς ἀνώμαλον δεῖ εἶναι. ἔστιν δὲ παράδειγμα πονηρίας μὲν ἤθους μὴ ἀναγκαίας οἷον ὁ Μενέλαος ὁ ἐν τῷ Ὀρέστῃ, τοῦ δὲ ἀπρεποῦς καὶ μὴ ἁρμόττοντος ὅ τε θρῆνος Ὀδυσσέως ἐν τῇ Σκύλλῃ καὶ ἡ τῆς Μελανίππης ῥῆσις, τοῦ δὲ ἀνωμάλου ἡ ἐν Αὐλίδι Ἰφιγένεια· οὐδὲν γὰρ ἔοικεν ἡ ἱκετεύουσα τῇ ὑστέρᾳ.

Χρὴ δὲ καὶ ἐν τοῖς ἤθεσιν ὁμοίως ὥσπερ καὶ ἐν τῇ τῶν πραγμάτων συστάσει ἀεὶ ζητεῖν ἢ τὸ ἀναγκαῖον ἢ τὸ εἰκός, ὥστε τὸν τοιοῦτον τὰ τοιαῦτα λέγειν ἢ πράττειν ἢ ἀναγκαῖον ἢ εἰκὸς καὶ τοῦτο μετὰ τοῦτο γίνεσθαι ἢ ἀναγκαῖον ἢ εἰκός. φανερὸν οὖν ὅτι καὶ τὰς λύσεις τῶν μύθων ἐξ αὐτοῦ δεῖ τοῦ μύθου συμβαίνειν, καὶ μὴ ὥσπερ ἐν τῇ Μηδείᾳ ἀπὸ μηχανῆς καὶ ἐν τῇ Ἰλιάδι τὰ περὶ τὸν ἀπόπλουν. ἀλλὰ μηχανῇ χρηστέον ἐπὶ τὰ ἔξω τοῦ δράματος, ἢ ὅσα πρὸ τοῦ γέγονεν ἃ οὐχ οἷόν τε ἄνθρωπον εἰδέναι, ἢ ὅσα ὕστερον, ἃ δεῖται προαγορεύσεως καὶ ἀγγελίας· ἅπαντα γὰρ ἀποδίδομεν τοῖς θεοῖς ὁρᾶν. ἄλογον δὲ μηδὲν εἶναι ἐν τοῖς πράγμασιν, εἰ δὲ μή, ἔξω τῆς τραγῳδίας, οἷον τὸ ἐν τῷ Οἰδίποδι τῷ Σοφοκλέους.

Ἐπεὶ δὲ μίμησίς ἐστιν ἡ τραγῳδία βελτιόνων ἢ ἡμεῖς, δεῖ μιμεῖσθαι τοὺς ἀγαθοὺς εἰκονογράφους· καὶ γὰρ ἐκεῖνοι ἀποδιδόντες τὴν ἰδίαν μορφὴν ὁμοίους ποιοῦντες καλλίους γράφουσιν· οὕτω καὶ τὸν ποιητὴν μιμούμενον καὶ ὀργίλους καὶ ῥᾳθύμους καὶ τἆλλα τὰ τοιαῦτα ἔχοντας ἐπὶ τῶν ἠθῶν τοιούτους ὄντας ἐπιεικεῖς ποιεῖν παράδειγμα σκληρότητος οἷον τὸν Ἀχιλλέα ἀγαθὸν καὶ Ὅμηρος.

Ταῦτα δὴ διατηρεῖν, καὶ πρὸς τούτοις τὰ παρὰ τὰς ἐξ ἀνάγκης ἀκολουθούσας αἰσθήσεις τῇ ποιητικῇ· καὶ γὰρ κατ᾽ αὐτὰς ἔστιν ἁμαρτάνειν πολλάκις· εἴρηται δὲ περὶ αὐτῶν ἐν τοῖς ἐκδεδομένοις λόγοις ἱκανῶς.

16. Ἀναγνώρισις δὲ τί μέν ἐστιν, εἴρηται πρότερον· εἴδη δὲ ἀναγνωρίσεως, πρώτη μὲν ἡ ἀτεχνοτάτη καὶ ᾗ πλείστῃ χρῶνται δι᾽ ἀπορίαν, ἡ διὰ τῶν σημείων. τούτων δὲ τὰ μὲν σύμφυτα, οἷον ‘λόγχην ἣν φοροῦσι Γηγενεῖς’ ἢ ἀστέρας οἵους ἐν τῷ Θυέστῃ Καρκίνος, τὰ δὲ ἐπίκτητα, καὶ τούτων τὰ μὲν ἐν τῷ σώματι, οἷον οὐλαί, τὰ δὲ ἐκτός, οἷον τὰ περιδέραια καὶ οἷον ἐν τῇ Τυροῖ διὰ τῆς σκάφης.

Ἔστιν δὲ καὶ τούτοις χρῆσθαι ἢ βέλτιον ἢ χεῖρον, οἷον Ὀδυσσεὺς διὰ τῆς οὐλῆς ἄλλως ἀνεγνωρίσθη ὑπὸ τῆς τροφοῦ καὶ ἄλλως ὑπὸ τῶν συβοτῶν· εἰσὶ γὰρ αἱ μὲν πίστεως ἕνεκα ἀτεχνότεραι, καὶ αἱ τοιαῦται πᾶσαι, αἱ δὲ ἐκ περιπετείας, ὥσπερ ἡ ἐν τοῖς Νίπτροις, βελτίους.

Δεύτεραι δὲ αἱ πεποιημέναι ὑπὸ τοῦ ποιητοῦ, διὸ ἄτεχνοι. Οἷον \[Ὀρέστης\] ἐν τῇ Ἰφιγενείᾳ ἀνεγνώρισεν ὅτι Ὀρέστης· ἐκείνη μὲν γὰρ διὰ τῆς ἐπιστολῆς, ἐκεῖνος δὲ αὐτὸς λέγει ἃ βούλεται ὁ ποιητὴς ἀλλ᾽ οὐχ ὁ μῦθος· διὸ ἐγγύς τι τῆς εἰρημένης ἁμαρτίας ἐστίν, ἐξῆν γὰρ ἂν ἔνια καὶ ἐνεγκεῖν. Καὶ ἐν τῷ Σοφοκλέους Τηρεῖ ἡ τῆς κερκίδος φωνή.

Ἡ τρίτη διὰ μνήμης, τῷ αἰσθέσθαι τι ἰδόντα, ὥσπερ ἡ ἐν Κυπρίοις τοῖς Δικαιογένους, ἰδὼν γὰρ τὴν γραφὴν ἔκλαυσεν, καὶ ἡ ἐν Ἀλκίνου ἀπολόγῳ, ἀκούων γὰρ τοῦ κιθαριστοῦ καὶ μνησθεὶς ἐδάκρυσεν, ὅθεν ἀνεγνωρίσθησαν.

Τετάρτη δὲ ἡ ἐκ συλλογισμοῦ, οἷον ἐν Χοηφόροις, ὅτι ὅμοιός τις ἐλήλυθεν, ὅμοιος δὲ οὐθεὶς ἀλλ᾽ ἢ Ὀρέστης, οὗτος ἄρα ἐλήλυθεν. καὶ ἡ Πολυΐδου τοῦ σοφιστοῦ περὶ τῆς Ἰφιγενείας· εἰκὸς γὰρ ἔφη τὸν Ὀρέστην συλλογίσασθαι ὅτι ἥ τ᾽ ἀδελφὴ ἐτύθη καὶ αὐτῷ συμβαίνει θύεσθαι. καὶ ἐν τῷ Θεοδέκτου Τυδεῖ, ὅτι ἐλθὼν ὡς εὑρήσων τὸν υἱὸν αὐτὸς ἀπόλλυται. καὶ ἡ ἐν τοῖς Φινείδαις· ἰδοῦσαι γὰρ τὸν τόπον συνελογίσαντο τὴν εἱμαρμένην ὅτι ἐν τούτῳ εἵμαρτο ἀποθανεῖν αὐταῖς, καὶ γὰρ ἐξετέθησαν ἐνταῦθα.

Ἔστιν δέ τις καὶ συνθετὴ ἐκ παραλογισμοῦ τοῦ θεάτρου, οἷον ἐν τῷ Ὀδυσσεῖ τῷ ψευδαγγέλῳ· τὸ μὲν γὰρ τὸ τόξον ἐντείνειν, ἄλλον \[δὲ\] μηδένα, πεποιημένον ὑπὸ τοῦ ποιητοῦ καὶ ὑπόθεσις, καὶ εἴ γε τὸ τόξον ἔφη γνώσεσθαι ὃ οὐχ ἑωράκει· τὸ δὲ ὡς δι᾽ ἐκείνου ἀναγνωριοῦντος διὰ τούτου ποιῆσαι παραλογισμός.

Πασῶν δὲ βελτίστη ἀναγνώρισις ἡ ἐξ αὐτῶν τῶν πραγμάτων, τῆς ἐκπλήξεως γιγνομένης δι᾽ εἰκότων, οἷον ἐν τῷ Σοφοκλέους Οἰδίποδι καὶ τῇ Ἰφιγενείᾳ· εἰκὸς γὰρ βούλεσθαι ἐπιθεῖναι γράμματα. αἱ γὰρ τοιαῦται μόναι ἄνευ τῶν πεποιημένων σημείων καὶ περιδεραίων. δεύτεραι δὲ αἱ ἐκ συλλογισμοῦ.

Δεῖ δὲ τοὺς μύθους συνιστάναι καὶ τῇ λέξει συναπεργάζεσθαι ὅτι μάλιστα πρὸ ὀμμάτων τιθέμενον· οὕτω γὰρ ἂν ἐναργέστατα \[ὁ\] ὁρῶν ὥσπερ παρ᾽ αὐτοῖς γιγνόμενος τοῖς πραττομένοις εὑρίσκοι τὸ πρέπον καὶ ἥκιστα ἂν λανθάνοι \[τὸ\] τὰ ὑπεναντία. σημεῖον δὲ τούτου ὃ ἐπετιμᾶτο Καρκίνῳ. ὁ γὰρ Ἀμφιάραος ἐξ ἱεροῦ ἀνῄει, ὃ μὴ ὁρῶντα τὸν θεατὴν ἐλάνθανεν, ἐπὶ δὲ τῆς σκηνῆς ἐξέπεσεν δυσχερανάντων τοῦτο τῶν θεατῶν. Ὅσα δὲ δυνατὸν καὶ τοῖς σχήμασιν συναπεργαζόμενον. πιθανώτατοι γὰρ ἀπὸ τῆς αὐτῆς φύσεως οἱ ἐν τοῖς πάθεσίν εἰσιν, καὶ χειμαίνει ὁ χειμαζόμενος καὶ χαλεπαίνει ὁ ὀργιζόμενος ἀληθινώτατα. διὸ εὐφυοῦς ἡ ποιητική ἐστιν ἢ μανικοῦ· τούτων γὰρ οἱ μὲν εὔπλαστοι οἱ δὲ ἐκστατικοί εἰσιν.

Τούς τε λόγους καὶ τοὺς πεποιημένους δεῖ καὶ αὐτὸν ποιοῦντα ἐκτίθεσθαι καθόλου, εἶθ᾽ οὕτως ἐπεισοδιοῦν καὶ παρατείνειν. Λέγω δὲ οὕτως ἂν θεωρεῖσθαι τὸ καθόλου, οἷον τῆς Ἰφιγενείας· τυθείσης τινὸς κόρης καὶ ἀφανισθείσης ἀδήλως τοῖς θύσασιν, ἱδρυνθείσης δὲ εἰς ἄλλην χώραν, ἐν ᾗ νόμος ἦν τοὺς ξένους θύειν τῇ θεῷ, ταύτην ἔσχε τὴν ἱερωσύνην· χρόνῳ δὲ ὕστερον τῷ ἀδελφῷ συνέβη ἐλθεῖν τῆς ἱερείας, τὸ δὲ ὅτι ἀνεῖλεν ὁ θεὸς \[διά τινα αἰτίαν ἔξω τοῦ καθόλου\] ἐλθεῖν ἐκεῖ καὶ ἐφ᾽ ὅ τι δὲ ἔξω τοῦ μύθου· ἐλθὼν δὲ καὶ ληφθεὶς θύεσθαι μέλλων ἀνεγνώρισεν, εἴθ᾽ ὡς Εὐριπίδης εἴθ᾽ ὡς Πολύιδος ἐποίησεν, κατὰ τὸ εἰκὸς εἰπὼν ὅτι οὐκ ἄρα μόνον τὴν ἀδελφὴν ἀλλὰ καὶ αὐτὸν ἔδει τυθῆναι, καὶ ἐντεῦθεν ἡ σωτηρία.

Μετὰ ταῦτα δὲ ἤδη ὑποθέντα τὰ ὀνόματα ἐπεισοδιοῦν· ὅπως δὲ ἔσται οἰκεῖα τὰ ἐπεισόδια, οἷον ἐν τῷ Ὀρέστῃ ἡ μανία δι᾽ ἧς ἐλήφθη καὶ ἡ σωτηρία διὰ τῆς καθάρσεως.

Ἐν μὲν οὖν τοῖς δράμασιν τὰ ἐπεισόδια σύντομα, ἡ δ᾽ ἐποποιία τούτοις μηκύνεται. τῆς γὰρ Ὀδυσσείας οὐ μακρὸς ὁ λόγος ἐστίν· ἀποδημοῦντός τινος ἔτη πολλὰ καὶ παραφυλαττομένου ὑπὸ τοῦ Ποσειδῶνος καὶ μόνου ὄντος, ἔτι δὲ τῶν οἴκοι οὕτως ἐχόντων ὥστε τὰ χρήματα ὑπὸ μνηστήρων ἀναλίσκεσθαι καὶ τὸν υἱὸν ἐπιβουλεύεσθαι, αὐτὸς δὲ ἀφικνεῖται χειμασθείς, καὶ ἀναγνωρίσας τινὰς ἐπιθέμενος αὐτὸς μὲν ἐσώθη τοὺς δ᾽ ἐχθροὺς διέφθειρε. τὸ μὲν οὖν ἴδιον τοῦτο, τὰ δ᾽ ἄλλα ἐπεισόδια.





 

18. Ἔστι δὲ πάσης τραγῳδίας τὸ μὲν δέσις τὸ δὲ λύσις, τὰ μὲν ἔξωθεν καὶ ἔνια τῶν ἔσωθεν πολλάκις ἡ δέσις, τὸ δὲ λοιπὸν ἡ λύσις· λέγω δὲ δέσιν μὲν εἶναι τὴν ἀπ᾽ ἀρχῆς μέχρι τούτου τοῦ μέρους ὃ ἔσχατόν ἐστιν ἐξ οὗ μεταβαίνει εἰς εὐτυχίαν ἢ εἰς ἀτυχίαν, λύσιν δὲ τὴν ἀπὸ τῆς ἀρχῆς τῆς μεταβάσεως μέχρι τέλους· ὥσπερ ἐν τῷ Λυγκεῖ τῷ Θεοδέκτου δέσις μὲν τά τε προπεπραγμένα καὶ ἡ τοῦ παιδίου λῆψις καὶ πάλιν ἡ αὐτῶν <λύσις> δ᾽ ἡ ἀπὸ τῆς αἰτιάσεως τοῦ θανάτου μέχρι τοῦ τέλους.

Τραγῳδίας δὲ εἴδη εἰσὶ τέσσαρα \(τοσαῦτα γὰρ καὶ τὰ μέρη ἐλέχθη\), ἡ μὲν πεπλεγμένη, ἧς τὸ ὅλον ἐστὶν περιπέτεια καὶ ἀναγνώρισις, ἡ δὲ παθητική, οἷον οἵ τε Αἴαντες καὶ οἱ Ἰξίονες, ἡ δὲ ἠθική, οἷον αἱ Φθιώτιδες καὶ ὁ Πηλεύς· τὸ δὲ τέταρτον ἀπλῆ οἷον αἵ τε Φορκίδες καὶ ὁ Προμηθεὺς καὶ ὅσα ἐν ᾍδου.

Μάλιστα μὲν οὖν ἅπαντα δεῖ πειρᾶσθαι ἔχειν, εἰ δὲ μή, τὰ μέγιστα καὶ πλεῖστα, ἄλλως τε καὶ ὡς νῦν συκοφαντοῦσιν τοὺς ποιητάς· γεγονότων γὰρ καθ᾽ ἕκαστον μέρος ἀγαθῶν ποιητῶν, ἑκάστου τοῦ ἰδίου ἀγαθοῦ ἀξιοῦσι τὸν ἕνα ὑπερβάλλειν. δίκαιον δὲ καὶ τραγῳδίαν ἄλλην καὶ τὴν αὐτὴν λέγειν οὐδενὶ ὡς τῷ μύθῳ· τοῦτο δέ, ὧν ἡ αὐτὴ πλοκὴ καὶ λύσις. πολλοὶ δὲ πλέξαντες εὖ λύουσι κακῶς· δεῖ δὲ ἀμφότερα ἀρτικροτεῖσθαι.

Χρὴ δὲ ὅπερ εἴρηται πολλάκις μεμνῆσθαι καὶ μὴ ποιεῖν ἐποποιικὸν σύστημα τραγῳδίαν. ἐποποιικὸν δὲ λέγω τὸ πολύμυθον, οἷον εἴ τις τὸν τῆς Ἰλιάδος ὅλον ποιοῖ μῦθον. ἐκεῖ μὲν γὰρ διὰ τὸ μῆκος λαμβάνει τὰ μέρη τὸ πρέπον μέγεθος, ἐν δὲ τοῖς δράμασι πολὺ παρὰ τὴν ὑπόληψιν ἀποβαίνει. σημεῖον δέ, ὅσοι πέρσιν Ἰλίου ὅλην ἐποίησαν καὶ μὴ κατὰ μέρος ὥσπερ Εὐριπίδης, <ἢ> Νιόβην καὶ μὴ ὥσπερ Αἰσχύλος, ἢ ἐκπίπτουσιν ἢ κακῶς ἀγωνίζονται, ἐπεὶ καὶ Ἀγάθων ἐξέπεσεν ἐν τούτῳ μόνῳ.

Ἐν δὲ ταῖς περιπετείαις καὶ ἐν τοῖς ἁπλοῖς πράγμασι στοχάζονται ὧν βούλονται θαυμαστῶς· τραγικὸν γὰρ τοῦτο καὶ φιλάνθρωπον. ἔστιν δὲ τοῦτο, ὅταν ὁ σοφὸς μὲν μετὰ πονηρίας <δ᾽> ἐξαπατηθῇ, ὥσπερ Σίσυφος, καὶ ὁ ἀνδρεῖος μὲν ἄδικος δὲ ἡττηθῇ. ἔστιν δὲ τοῦτο καὶ εἰκὸς ὥσπερ Ἀγάθων λέγει, εἰκὸς γὰρ γίνεσθαι πολλὰ καὶ παρὰ τὸ εἰκός.

Καὶ τὸν χορὸν δὲ ἕνα δεῖ ὑπολαμβάνειν τῶν ὑποκριτῶν, καὶ μόριον εἶναι τοῦ ὅλου καὶ συναγωνίζεσθαι μὴ ὥσπερ Εὐριπίδῃ ἀλλ᾽ ὥσπερ Σοφοκλεῖ. τοῖς δὲ λοιποῖς τὰ ᾀδόμενα οὐδὲν μᾶλλον τοῦ μύθου ἢ ἄλλης τραγῳδίας ἐστίν· διὸ ἐμβόλιμα ᾄδουσιν πρώτου ἄρξαντος Ἀγάθωνος τοῦ τοιούτου. καίτοι τί διαφέρει ἢ ἐμβόλιμα ᾄδειν ἢ εἰ ῥῆσιν ἐξ ἄλλου εἰς ἄλλο ἁρμόττοι ἢ ἐπεισόδιον ὅλον;





 

19. Περὶ μὲν οὖν τῶν ἄλλων εἰδῶν εἴρηται, λοιπὸν δὲ περὶ λέξεως καὶ διανοίας εἰπεῖν.

Τὰ μὲν οὖν περὶ τὴν διάνοιαν ἐν τοῖς περὶ ῥητορικῆς κείσθω· τοῦτο γὰρ ἴδιον μᾶλλον ἐκείνης τῆς μεθόδου. ἔστι δὲ κατὰ τὴν διάνοιαν ταῦτα, ὅσα ὑπὸ τοῦ λόγου δεῖ παρασκευασθῆναι. μέρη δὲ τούτων τό τε ἀποδεικνύναι καὶ τὸ λύειν καὶ τὸ πάθη παρασκευάζειν \(οἷον ἔλεον ἢ φόβον ἢ ὀργὴν καὶ ὅσα τοιαῦτα\) καὶ ἔτι μέγεθος καὶ μικρότητας.

Δῆλον δὲ ὅτι καὶ ἐν τοῖς πράγμασιν ἀπὸ τῶν αὐτῶν ἰδεῶν δεῖ χρῆσθαι ὅταν ἢ ἐλεεινὰ ἢ δεινὰ ἢ μεγάλα ἢ εἰκότα δέῃ παρασκευάζειν· πλὴν τοσοῦτον διαφέρει, ὅτι τὰ μὲν δεῖ φαίνεσθαι ἄνευ διδασκαλίας, τὰ δὲ ἐν τῷ λόγῳ ὑπὸ τοῦ λέγοντος παρασκευάζεσθαι καὶ παρὰ τὸν λόγον γίγνεσθαι. τί γὰρ ἂν εἴη τοῦ λέγοντος ἔργον, εἰ φαίνοιτο ᾗ δέοι καὶ μὴ διὰ τὸν λόγον;

Τῶν δὲ περὶ τὴν λέξιν ἓν μέν ἐστιν εἶδος θεωρίας τὰ σχήματα τῆς λέξεως, ἅ ἐστιν εἰδέναι τῆς ὑποκριτικῆς καὶ τοῦ τὴν τοιαύτην ἔχοντος ἀρχιτεκτονικήν, οἷον τί ἐντολὴ καὶ τί εὐχὴ καὶ διήγησις καὶ ἀπειλὴ καὶ ἐρώτησις καὶ ἀπόκρισις καὶ εἴ τι ἄλλο τοιοῦτον. παρὰ γὰρ τὴν τούτων γνῶσιν ἢ ἄγνοιαν οὐδὲν εἰς τὴν ποιητικὴν ἐπιτίμημα φέρεται ὅ τι καὶ ἄξιον σπουδῆς. τί γὰρ ἄν τις ὑπολάβοι ἡμαρτῆσθαι ἃ Πρωταγόρας ἐπιτιμᾷ, ὅτι εὔχεσθαι οἰόμενος ἐπιτάττει εἰπὼν ‘Μῆνιν ἄειδε θεά’; τὸ γὰρ κελεῦσαι, φησίν, ποιεῖν τι ἢ μὴ ἐπίταξίς ἐστιν. διὸ παρείσθω ὡς ἄλλης καὶ οὐ τῆς ποιητικῆς ὂν θεώρημα.





 

20. Τῆς δὲ λέξεως ἁπάσης τάδ᾽ ἐστὶ τὰ μέρη, στοιχεῖον συλλαβὴ σύνδεσμος ὄνομα ῥῆμα ἄρθρον πτῶσις λόγος.

Στοιχεῖον μὲν οὖν ἐστιν φωνὴ ἀδιαίρετος, οὐ πᾶσα δὲ ἀλλ᾽ ἐξ ἧς πέφυκε συνθετὴ γίγνεσθαι φωνή· καὶ γὰρ τῶν θηρίων εἰσὶν ἀδιαίρετοι φωναί, ὧν οὐδεμίαν λέγω στοιχεῖον. ταύτης δὲ μέρη τό τε φωνῆεν καὶ τὸ ἡμίφωνον καὶ ἄφωνον. ἔστιν δὲ ταῦτα φωνῆεν μὲν <τὸ> ἄνευ προσβολῆς ἔχον φωνὴν ἀκουστήν, ἡμίφωνον δὲ τὸ μετὰ προσβολῆς ἔχον φωνὴν ἀκουστήν, οἷον τὸ Σ καὶ τὸ Ρ, ἄφωνον δὲ τὸ μετὰ προσβολῆς καθ᾽ αὑτὸ μὲν οὐδεμίαν ἔχον φωνήν, μετὰ δὲ τῶν ἐχόντων τινὰ φωνὴν γινόμενον ἀκουστόν, οἷον τὸ Γ καὶ τὸ Δ. ταῦτα δὲ διαφέρει σχήμασίν τε τοῦ στόματος καὶ τόποις καὶ δασύτητι καὶ ψιλότητι καὶ μήκει καὶ βραχύτητι ἔτι δὲ ὀξύτητι καὶ βαρύτητι καὶ τῷ μέσῳ· περὶ ὧν καθ᾽ ἕκαστον ἐν τοῖς μετρικοῖς προσήκει θεωρεῖν.

Συλλαβὴ δέ ἐστιν φωνὴ ἄσημος συνθετὴ ἐξ ἀφώνου καὶ φωνὴν ἔχοντος· καὶ γὰρ τὸ ΓΡ ἄνευ τοῦ Α συλλαβὴ καὶ μετὰ τοῦ Α, οἷον τὸ ΓΡΑ. Ἀλλὰ καὶ τούτων θεωρῆσαι τὰς διαφορὰς τῆς μετρικῆς ἐστιν.

Σύνδεσμος δέ ἐστιν φωνὴ ἄσημος ἣ οὔτε κωλύει οὔτε ποιεῖ φωνὴν μίαν σημαντικὴν ἐκ πλειόνων φωνῶν πεφυκυῖα συντίθεσθαι καὶ ἐπὶ τῶν ἄκρων καὶ ἐπὶ τοῦ μέσου ἣν μὴ ἁρμόττει ἐν ἀρχῇ λόγου τιθέναι καθ᾽ αὑτήν, οἷον ‘μέν’, ‘ἤτοι’, ‘δέ’. ἢ φωνὴ ἄσημος ἣ ἐκ πλειόνων μὲν φωνῶν μιᾶς σημαντικῶν δὲ ποιεῖν πέφυκεν μίαν σημαντικὴν φωνήν.

Ἄρθρον δ᾽ ἐστὶ φωνὴ ἄσημος ἣ λόγου ἀρχὴν ἢ τέλος ἢ διορισμὸν δηλοῖ. οἷον τὸ ‘ἀμφί’ καὶ τὸ ‘περί’ καὶ τὰ ἄλλα. \[Ἢ φωνὴ ἄσημος ἣ οὔτε κωλύει οὔτε ποιεῖ φωνὴν μίαν σημαντικὴν ἐκ πλειόνων φωνῶν πεφυκυῖα τίθεσθαι καὶ ἐπὶ τῶν ἄκρων καὶ ἐπὶ τοῦ μέσου.\]

Ὄνομα δέ ἐστι φωνὴ συνθετὴ σημαντικὴ ἄνευ χρόνου ἧς μέρος οὐδέν ἐστι καθ᾽ αὑτὸ σημαντικόν· ἐν γὰρ τοῖς διπλοῖς οὐ χρώμεθα ὡς καὶ αὐτὸ καθ᾽ αὑτὸ σημαῖνον, οἷον ἐν τῷ ‘Θεόδωρος τὸ δωρος’ οὐ σημαίνει.

Ῥῆμα δὲ φωνὴ συνθετὴ σημαντικὴ μετὰ χρόνου ἧς οὐδὲν μέρος σημαίνει καθ᾽ αὑτό, ὥσπερ καὶ ἐπὶ τῶν ὀνομάτων· τὸ μὲν γὰρ ‘ἄνθρωπος’ ἢ ‘λευκόν’ οὐ σημαίνει τὸ πότε, τὸ δὲ ‘βαδίζει’ ἢ ‘βεβάδικεν’ προσσημαίνει τὸ μὲν τὸν παρόντα χρόνον τὸ δὲ τὸν παρεληλυθότα.

Πτῶσις δ᾽ ἐστὶν ὀνόματος ἢ ῥήματος ἡ μὲν κατὰ τὸ ‘τούτου ’ἢ ‘τούτῳ’ σημαῖνον καὶ ὅσα τοιαῦτα, ἡ δὲ κατὰ τὸ ἑνὶ ἢ πολλοῖς, οἷον ‘ἄνθρωποι’ ἢ ‘ἄνθρωπος’, ἡ δὲ κατὰ τὰ ὑποκριτικά, οἷον κατ᾽ ἐρώτησιν ἐπίταξιν· τὸ γὰρ ‘ἐβάδισεν’ ἢ ‘βάδιζε’ πτῶσις ῥήματος κατὰ ταῦτα τὰ εἴδη ἐστίν.

Λόγος δὲ φωνὴ συνθετὴ σημαντικὴ ἧς ἔνια μέρη καθ᾽ αὑτὰ σημαίνει τι \(οὐ γὰρ ἅπας λόγος ἐκ ῥημάτων καὶ ὀνομάτων σύγκειται, οἷον ὁ τοῦ ἀνθρώπου ὁρισμός, ἀλλ᾽ ἐνδέχεται ἄνευ ῥημάτων εἶναι λόγον, μέρος μέντοι ἀεί τι σημαῖνον ἕξει\) οἷον ἐν τῷ ‘βαδίζει Κλέων ὁ Κλέων’. εἷς δέ ἐστι λόγος διχῶς, ἢ γὰρ ὁ ἓν σημαίνων, ἢ ὁ ἐκ πλειόνων συνδέσμῳ, οἷον ἡ Ἰλιὰς μὲν συνδέσμῳ εἷς, ὁ δὲ τοῦ ἀνθρώπου τῷ ἓν σημαίνειν.

 

21. Ὀνόματος δὲ εἴδη τὸ μὲν ἁπλοῦν, ἁπλοῦν δὲ λέγω ὃ μὴ ἐκ σημαινόντων σύγκειται, οἷον γῆ, τὸ δὲ διπλοῦν· τούτου δὲ τὸ μὲν ἐκ σημαίνοντος καὶ ἀσήμου, πλὴν οὐκ ἐν τῷ ὀνόματι σημαίνοντος καὶ ἀσήμου, τὸ δὲ ἐκ σημαινόντων σύγκειται. εἴη δ᾽ ἂν καὶ τριπλοῦν καὶ τετραπλοῦν ὄνομα καὶ πολλαπλοῦν, οἷον τὰ πολλὰ τῶν Μασσαλιωτῶν, ‘Ἑρμοκαϊκόξανθος’ …

Ἅπαν δὲ ὄνομά ἐστιν ἢ κύριον ἢ γλῶττα ἢ μεταφορὰ ἢ κόσμος ἢ πεποιημένον ἢ ἐπεκτεταμένον ἢ ὑφῃρημένον ἢ ἐξηλλαγμένον.

Λέγω δὲ κύριον μὲν ᾧ χρῶνται ἕκαστοι, γλῶτταν δὲ ᾧ ἕτεροι· ὥστε φανερὸν ὅτι καὶ γλῶτταν καὶ κύριον εἶναι δυνατὸν τὸ αὐτό, μὴ τοῖς αὐτοῖς δέ· τὸ γὰρ ‘σίγυνον’ Κυπρίοις μὲν κύριον, ἡμῖν δὲ γλῶττα.

Μεταφορὰ δέ ἐστιν ὀνόματος ἀλλοτρίου ἐπιφορὰ ἢ ἀπὸ τοῦ γένους ἐπὶ εἶδος ἢ ἀπὸ τοῦ εἴδους ἐπὶ τὸ γένος ἢ ἀπὸ τοῦ εἴδους ἐπὶ εἶδος ἢ κατὰ τὸ ἀνάλογον. λέγω δὲ ἀπὸ γένους μὲν ἐπὶ εἶδος οἷον ‘νηῦς δέ μοι ἥδ᾽ ἕστηκεν’· τὸ γὰρ ὁρμεῖν ἐστιν ἑστάναι τι. ἀπ᾽ εἴδους δὲ ἐπὶ γένος ‘ἦ δὴ μυρί᾽ Ὀδυσσεὺς ἐσθλὰ ἔοργεν’· τὸ γὰρ μυρίον πολύ ἐστιν, ᾧ νῦν ἀντὶ τοῦ πολλοῦ κέχρηται. ἀπ᾽ εἴδους δὲ ἐπὶ εἶδος οἷον ‘χαλκῷ ἀπὸ ψυχὴν ἀρύσας’ καὶ ‘τεμὼν ταναήκεϊ χαλκῷ’· ἐνταῦθα γὰρ τὸ μὲν ἀρύσαι ταμεῖν, τὸ δὲ ταμεῖν ἀρύσαι εἴρηκεν· ἄμφω γὰρ ἀφελεῖν τί ἐστιν.

Τὸ δὲ ἀνάλογον λέγω, ὅταν ὁμοίως ἔχῃ τὸ δεύτερον πρὸς τὸ πρῶτον καὶ τὸ τέταρτον πρὸς τὸ τρίτον· ἐρεῖ γὰρ ἀντὶ τοῦ δευτέρου τὸ τέταρτον ἢ ἀντὶ τοῦ τετάρτου τὸ δεύτερον. καὶ ἐνίοτε προστιθέασιν ἀνθ᾽ οὗ λέγει πρὸς ὅ ἐστι. λέγω δὲ οἷον ὁμοίως ἔχει φιάλη πρὸς Διόνυσον καὶ ἀσπὶς πρὸς Ἄρη· ἐρεῖ τοίνυν τὴν φιάλην ‘ἀσπίδα Διονύσου’ καὶ τὴν ἀσπίδα ‘φιάλην Ἄρεως’. ἢ ὃ γῆρας πρὸς βίον, καὶ ἑσπέρα πρὸς ἡμέραν· ἐρεῖ τοίνυν τὴν ἑσπέραν ‘γῆρας ἡμέρας’ ἢ ὥσπερ Ἐμπεδοκλῆς, καὶ τὸ γῆρας ‘ἑσπέραν βίου’ ἢ ‘δυσμὰς βίου’. ἐνίοις δ᾽ οὐκ ἔστιν ὄνομα κείμενον τῶν ἀνάλογον, ἀλλ᾽ οὐδὲν ἧττον ὁμοίως λεχθήσεται· οἷον τὸ τὸν καρπὸν μὲν ἀφιέναι σπείρειν, τὸ δὲ τὴν φλόγα ἀπὸ τοῦ ἡλίου ἀνώνυμον· ἀλλ᾽ ὁμοίως ἔχει τοῦτο πρὸς τὸν ἥλιον καὶ τὸ σπείρειν πρὸς τὸν καρπόν, διὸ εἴρηται ‘σπείρων θεοκτίσταν φλόγα’. ἔστι δὲ τῷ τρόπῳ τούτῳ τῆς μεταφορᾶς χρῆσθαι καὶ ἄλλως, προσαγορεύσαντα τὸ ἀλλότριον ἀποφῆσαι τῶν οἰκείων τι, οἷον εἰ τὴν ἀσπίδα εἴποι ‘φιάλην μὴ Ἄρεως ἀλλ᾽ ἄοινον’ …

Πεποιημένον δ᾽ ἐστὶν ὃ ὅλως μὴ καλούμενον ὑπὸ τινῶν αὐτὸς τίθεται ὁ ποιητής, δοκεῖ γὰρ ἔνια εἶναι τοιαῦτα, οἷον τὰ κέρατα ‘ἔρνυγας’ καὶ τὸν ἱερέα ‘ἀρητῆρα’.

Ἐπεκτεταμένον δέ ἐστιν ἢ ἀφῃρημένον, τὸ μὲν ἐὰν φωνήεντι μακροτέρῳ κεχρημένον ᾖ τοῦ οἰκείου ἢ συλλαβῇ ἐμβεβλημένῃ, τὸ δὲ ἂν ἀφῃρημένον τι ᾖ αὐτοῦ, ἐπεκτεταμένον μὲν οἷον τὸ πόλεως ‘πόληος’ καὶ τὸ Πηλείδου ‘Πηληιάδεω’, ἀφῃρημένον δὲ οἷον τὸ ‘κρῖ’ καὶ τὸ ‘δῶ’ καὶ ‘μία γίνεται ἀμφοτέρων ὄψ’.

Ἐξηλλαγμένον δ᾽ ἐστὶν ὅταν τοῦ ὀνομαζομένου τὸ μὲν καταλείπῃ τὸ δὲ ποιῇ, οἷον τὸ ‘δεξιτερὸν κατὰ μαζόν’ ἀντὶ τοῦ ‘δεξιόν’.

Αὐτῶν δὲ τῶν ὀνομάτων τὰ μὲν ἄρρενα τὰ δὲ θήλεα τὰ δὲ μεταξύ, ἄρρενα μὲν ὅσα τελευτᾷ εἰς τὸ Ν καὶ Ρ καὶ Σ καὶ ὅσα ἐκ τούτου σύγκειται \(ταῦτα δ᾽ ἐστὶν δύο, Ψ καὶ Ξ\), θήλεα δὲ ὅσα ἐκ τῶν φωνηέντων εἴς τε τὰ ἀεὶ μακρά, οἷον εἰς Η καὶ Ω, καὶ τῶν ἐπεκτεινομένων εἰς Α· ὥστε ἴσα συμβαίνει πλήθει εἰς ὅσα τὰ ἄρρενα καὶ τὰ θήλεα· τὸ γὰρ Ψ καὶ τὸ Ξ σύνθετά ἐστιν. εἰς δὲ ἄφωνον οὐδὲν ὄνομα τελευτᾷ, οὐδὲ εἰς φωνῆεν βραχύ. εἰς δὲ τὸ Ι τρία μόνον, ‘μέλι’, ‘κόμμι’, ‘πέπερι’. εἰς δὲ τὸ Υ πέντε, τὸ ‘δόρυ’, τὸ ‘πῶυ’, τὸ ‘νᾶπυ’, τὸ ‘γόνυ’, τὸ ‘ἄστυ’. τὰ δὲ μεταξὺ εἰς ταῦτα καὶ Ν καὶ Σ.





 

22. Λέξεως δὲ ἀρετὴ σαφῆ καὶ μὴ ταπεινὴν εἶναι. σαφεστάτη μὲν οὖν ἐστιν ἡ ἐκ τῶν κυρίων ὀνομάτων, ἀλλὰ ταπεινή· παράδειγμα δὲ ἡ Κλεοφῶντος ποίησις καὶ ἡ Σθενέλου. σεμνὴ δὲ καὶ ἐξαλλάττουσα τὸ ἰδιωτικὸν ἡ τοῖς ξενικοῖς κεχρημένη· ξενικὸν δὲ λέγω γλῶτταν καὶ μεταφορὰν καὶ ἐπέκτασιν καὶ πᾶν τὸ παρὰ τὸ κύριον. ἀλλ᾽ ἄν τις ἅπαντα τοιαῦτα ποιήσῃ, ἢ αἴνιγμα ἔσται ἢ βαρβαρισμός· ἂν μὲν οὖν ἐκ μεταφορῶν, αἴνιγμα, ἐὰν δὲ ἐκ γλωττῶν, βαρβαρισμός. Αἰνίγματός τε γὰρ ἰδέα αὕτη ἐστί, τὸ λέγοντα ὑπάρχοντα ἀδύνατα συνάψαι· κατὰ μὲν οὖν τὴν τῶν <ἄλλων> ὀνομάτων σύνθεσιν οὐχ οἷόν τε τοῦτο ποιῆσαι, κατὰ δὲ τὴν μεταφορῶν ἐνδέχεται, οἷον ‘ἄνδρ᾽ εἶδον πυρὶ χαλκὸν ἐπ᾽ ἀνέρι κολλήσαντα’, καὶ τὰ τοιαῦτα. τὰ δὲ ἐκ τῶν γλωττῶν βαρβαρισμός.

Δεῖ ἄρα κεκρᾶσθαί πως τούτοις· τὸ μὲν γὰρ τὸ μὴ ἰδιωτικὸν ποιήσει μηδὲ ταπεινόν, οἷον ἡ γλῶττα καὶ ἡ μεταφορὰ καὶ ὁ κόσμος καὶ τἆλλα τὰ εἰρημένα εἴδη, τὸ δὲ κύριον τὴν σαφήνειαν.

Οὐκ ἐλάχιστον δὲ μέρος συμβάλλεται εἰς τὸ σαφὲς τῆς λέξεως καὶ μὴ ἰδιωτικὸν αἱ ἐπεκτάσεις καὶ ἀποκοπαὶ καὶ ἐξαλλαγαὶ τῶν ὀνομάτων· διὰ μὲν γὰρ τὸ ἄλλως ἔχειν ἢ ὡς τὸ κύριον παρὰ τὸ εἰωθὸς γιγνόμενον τὸ μὴ ἰδιωτικὸν ποιήσει, διὰ δὲ τὸ κοινωνεῖν τοῦ εἰωθότος τὸ σαφὲς ἔσται. ὥστε οὐκ ὀρθῶς ψέγουσιν οἱ ἐπιτιμῶντες τῷ τοιούτῳ τρόπῳ τῆς διαλέκτου καὶ διακωμῳδοῦντες τὸν ποιητήν, οἷον Εὐκλείδης ὁ ἀρχαῖος, ὡς ῥᾴδιον ὂν ποιεῖν εἴ τις δώσει ἐκτείνειν ἐφ᾽ ὁπόσον βούλεται, ἰαμβοποιήσας ἐν αὐτῇ τῇ λέξει

Ἐπιχάρην εἶδον Μαραθῶνάδε βαδίζοντα, καὶ οὐκ ἂν γεράμενος τὸν ἐκείνου ἐλλέβορον.

Τὸ μὲν οὖν φαίνεσθαί πως χρώμενον τούτῳ τῷ τρόπῳ γελοῖον· τὸ δὲ μέτρον κοινὸν ἁπάντων ἐστὶ τῶν μερῶν· καὶ γὰρ μεταφοραῖς καὶ γλώτταις καὶ τοῖς ἄλλοις εἴδεσι χρώμενος ἀπρεπῶς καὶ ἐπίτηδες ἐπὶ τὰ γελοῖα τὸ αὐτὸ ἂν ἀπεργάσαιτο.

Τὸ δὲ ἁρμόττον ὅσον διαφέρει ἐπὶ τῶν ἐπῶν θεωρείσθω ἐντιθεμένων τῶν ὀνομάτων εἰς τὸ μέτρον. καὶ ἐπὶ τῆς γλώττης δὲ καὶ ἐπὶ τῶν μεταφορῶν καὶ ἐπὶ τῶν ἄλλων ἰδεῶν μετατιθεὶς ἄν τις τὰ κύρια ὀνόματα κατίδοι ὅτι ἀληθῆ λέγομεν· οἷον τὸ αὐτὸ ποιήσαντος ἰαμβεῖον Αἰσχύλου καὶ Εὐριπίδου, ἓν δὲ μόνον ὄνομα μεταθέντος, ἀντὶ κυρίου εἰωθότος γλῶτταν, τὸ μὲν φαίνεται καλὸν τὸ δ᾽ εὐτελές. Αἰσχύλος μὲν γὰρ ἐν τῷ Φιλοκτήτῃ ἐποίησε

φαγέδαιναν ἥ μου σάρκας ἐσθίει ποδός,

ὁ δὲ ἀντὶ τοῦ ‘ἐσθίει’ τὸ ‘θοινᾶται’ μετέθηκεν. καὶ

νῦν δέ μ᾽ ἐὼν ὀλίγος τε καὶ οὐτιδανὸς καὶ ἀεικής,

εἴ τις λέγοι τὰ κύρια μετατιθεὶς

νῦν δέ μ᾽ ἐὼν μικρός τε καὶ ἀσθενικὸς καὶ ἀειδής·

καὶ

δίφρον ἀεικέλιον καταθεὶς ὀλίγην τε τράπεζαν,

δίφρον μοχθηρὸν καταθεὶς μικράν τε τράπεζαν·

καὶ τὸ ‘ἠιόνες βοόωσιν, ἠιόνες κράζουσιν’.

Ἔτι δὲ Ἀριφράδης τοὺς τραγῳδοὺς ἐκωμῴδει ὅτι ἃ οὐδεὶς ἂν εἴπειεν ἐν τῇ διαλέκτῳ τούτοις χρῶνται, οἷον τὸ ‘δωμάτων ἄπο’ ἀλλὰ μὴ ‘ἀπὸ δωμάτων’, καὶ τὸ ‘σέθεν’ καὶ τὸ ‘ἐγὼ δέ νιν’ καὶ τὸ ‘Ἀχιλλέως πέρι’ ἀλλὰ μὴ ‘περὶ Ἀχιλλέως’, καὶ ὅσα ἄλλα τοιαῦτα. διὰ γὰρ τὸ μὴ εἶναι ἐν τοῖς κυρίοις ποιεῖ τὸ μὴ ἰδιωτικὸν ἐν τῇ λέξει ἅπαντα τὰ τοιαῦτα· ἐκεῖνος δὲ τοῦτο ἠγνόει.

Ἔστιν δὲ μέγα μὲν τὸ ἑκάστῳ τῶν εἰρημένων πρεπόντως χρῆσθαι, καὶ διπλοῖς ὀνόμασι καὶ γλώτταις, πολὺ δὲ μέγιστον τὸ μεταφορικὸν εἶναι. μόνον γὰρ τοῦτο οὔτε παρ᾽ ἄλλου ἔστι λαβεῖν εὐφυΐας τε σημεῖόν ἐστι· τὸ γὰρ εὖ μεταφέρειν τὸ τὸ ὅμοιον θεωρεῖν ἐστιν.

Τῶν δ᾽ ὀνομάτων τὰ μὲν διπλᾶ μάλιστα ἁρμόττει τοῖς διθυράμβοις, αἱ δὲ γλῶτται τοῖς ἡρωικοῖς, αἱ δὲ μεταφοραὶ τοῖς ἰαμβείοις. καὶ ἐν μὲν τοῖς ἡρωικοῖς ἅπαντα χρήσιμα τὰ εἰρημένα, ἐν δὲ τοῖς ἰαμβείοις διὰ τὸ ὅτι μάλιστα λέξιν μιμεῖσθαι ταῦτα ἁρμόττει τῶν ὀνομάτων ὅσοις κἂν ἐν λόγοις τις χρήσαιτο· ἔστι δὲ τὰ τοιαῦτα τὸ κύριον καὶ μεταφορὰ καὶ κόσμος.

Περὶ μὲν οὖν τραγῳδίας καὶ τῆς ἐν τῷ πράττειν μιμήσεως ἔστω ἡμῖν ἱκανὰ τὰ εἰρημένα.

23. Περὶ δὲ τῆς διηγηματικῆς καὶ ἐν μέτρῳ μιμητικῆς, ὅτι δεῖ τοὺς μύθους καθάπερ ἐν ταῖς τραγῳδίαις συνιστάναι δραματικοὺς καὶ περὶ μίαν πρᾶξιν ὅλην καὶ τελείαν ἔχουσαν ἀρχὴν καὶ μέσα καὶ τέλος, ἵν᾽ ὥσπερ ζῷον ἓν ὅλον ποιῇ τὴν οἰκείαν ἡδονήν, δῆλον, καὶ μὴ ὁμοίας ἱστορίαις τὰς συνθέσεις εἶναι, ἐν αἷς ἀνάγκη οὐχὶ μιᾶς πράξεως ποιεῖσθαι δήλωσιν ἀλλ᾽ ἑνὸς χρόνου, ὅσα ἐν τούτῳ συνέβη περὶ ἕνα ἢ πλείους, ὧν ἕκαστον ὡς ἔτυχεν ἔχει πρὸς ἄλληλα. ὥσπερ γὰρ κατὰ τοὺς αὐτοὺς χρόνους ἥ τ᾽ ἐν Σαλαμῖνι ἐγένετο ναυμαχία καὶ ἡ ἐν Σικελίᾳ Καρχηδονίων μάχη οὐδὲν πρὸς τὸ αὐτὸ συντείνουσαι τέλος, οὕτω καὶ ἐν τοῖς ἐφεξῆς χρόνοις ἐνίοτε γίνεται θάτερον μετὰ θάτερον, ἐξ ὧν ἓν οὐδὲν γίνεται τέλος. σχεδὸν δὲ οἱ πολλοὶ τῶν ποιητῶν τοῦτο δρῶσι.

Διὸ ὥσπερ εἴπομεν ἤδη καὶ ταύτῃ θεσπέσιος ἂν φανείη Ὅμηρος παρὰ τοὺς ἄλλους, τῷ μηδὲ τὸν πόλεμον καίπερ ἔχοντα ἀρχὴν καὶ τέλος ἐπιχειρῆσαι ποιεῖν ὅλον· λίαν γὰρ ἂν μέγας καὶ οὐκ εὐσύνοπτος ἔμελλεν ἔσεσθαι ὁ μῦθος, ἢ τῷ μεγέθει μετριάζοντα καταπεπλεγμένον τῇ ποικιλίᾳ. νῦν δ᾽ ἓν μέρος ἀπολαβὼν ἐπεισοδίοις κέχρηται αὐτῶν πολλοῖς, οἷον νεῶν καταλόγῳ καὶ ἄλλοις ἐπεισοδίοις \[δὶς\] διαλαμβάνει τὴν ποίησιν. οἱ δ᾽ ἄλλοι περὶ ἕνα ποιοῦσι καὶ περὶ ἕνα χρόνον καὶ μίαν πρᾶξιν πολυμερῆ, οἷον ὁ τὰ Κύπρια ποιήσας καὶ τὴν μικρὰν Ἰλιάδα. τοιγαροῦν ἐκ μὲν Ἰλιάδος καὶ Ὀδυσσείας μία τραγῳδία ποιεῖται ἑκατέρας ἢ δύο μόναι, ἐκ δὲ Κυπρίων πολλαὶ καὶ τῆς μικρᾶς Ἰλιάδος \[\[πλέον\] ὀκτώ, οἷον ὅπλων κρίσις, Φιλοκτήτης, Νεοπτόλεμος, Εὐρύπυλος, πτωχεία, Λάκαιναι, Ἰλίου πέρσις καὶ ἀπόπλους \[καὶ Σίνων καὶ Τρῳάδες\]\].





 

24. Ἔτι δὲ τὰ εἴδη ταὐτὰ δεῖ ἔχειν τὴν ἐποποιίαν τῇ τραγῳδίᾳ, ἢ γὰρ ἁπλῆν ἢ πεπλεγμένην ἢ ἠθικὴν ἢ παθητικήν· καὶ τὰ μέρη ἔξω μελοποιίας καὶ ὄψεως ταὐτά· καὶ γὰρ περιπετειῶν δεῖ καὶ ἀναγνωρίσεων καὶ παθημάτων· ἔτι τὰς διανοίας καὶ τὴν λέξιν ἔχειν καλῶς. οἷς ἅπασιν Ὅμηρος κέχρηται καὶ πρῶτος καὶ ἱκανῶς. καὶ γὰρ τῶν ποιημάτων ἑκάτερον συνέστηκεν ἡ μὲν Ἰλιὰς ἁπλοῦν καὶ παθητικόν, ἡ δὲ Ὀδύσσεια πεπλεγμένον \(ἀναγνώρισις γὰρ διόλου\) καὶ ἠθική· πρὸς δὲ τούτοις λέξει καὶ διανοίᾳ πάντα ὑπερβέβληκεν.

Διαφέρει δὲ κατά τε τῆς συστάσεως τὸ μῆκος ἡ ἐποποιία καὶ τὸ μέτρον. τοῦ μὲν οὖν μήκους ὅρος ἱκανὸς ὁ εἰρημένος· δύνασθαι γὰρ δεῖ συνορᾶσθαι τὴν ἀρχὴν καὶ τὸ τέλος. εἴη δ᾽ ἂν τοῦτο, εἰ τῶν μὲν ἀρχαίων ἐλάττους αἱ συστάσεις εἶεν, πρὸς δὲ τὸ πλῆθος τραγῳδιῶν τῶν εἰς μίαν ἀκρόασιν τιθεμένων παρήκοιεν. ἔχει δὲ πρὸς τὸ ἐπεκτείνεσθαι τὸ μέγεθος πολύ τι ἡ ἐποποιία ἴδιον διὰ τὸ ἐν μὲν τῇ τραγῳδίᾳ μὴ ἐνδέχεσθαι ἅμα πραττόμενα πολλὰ μέρη μιμεῖσθαι ἀλλὰ τὸ ἐπὶ τῆς σκηνῆς καὶ τῶν ὑποκριτῶν μέρος μόνον· ἐν δὲ τῇ ἐποποιίᾳ διὰ τὸ διήγησιν εἶναι ἔστι πολλὰ μέρη ἅμα ποιεῖν περαινόμενα, ὑφ᾽ ὧν οἰκείων ὄντων αὔξεται ὁ τοῦ ποιήματος ὄγκος. ὥστε τοῦτ᾽ ἔχει τὸ ἀγαθὸν εἰς μεγαλοπρέπειαν καὶ τὸ μεταβάλλειν τὸν ἀκούοντα καὶ ἐπεισοδιοῦν ἀνομοίοις ἐπεισοδίοις· τὸ γὰρ ὅμοιον ταχὺ πληροῦν ἐκπίπτειν ποιεῖ τὰς τραγῳδίας.

Τὸ δὲ μέτρον τὸ ἡρωικὸν ἀπὸ τῆς πείρας ἥρμοκεν. εἰ γάρ τις ἐν ἄλλῳ τινὶ μέτρῳ διηγηματικὴν μίμησιν ποιοῖτο ἢ ἐν πολλοῖς, ἀπρεπὲς ἂν φαίνοιτο· τὸ γὰρ ἡρωικὸν στασιμώτατον καὶ ὀγκωδέστατον τῶν μέτρων ἐστίν \(διὸ καὶ γλώττας καὶ μεταφορὰς δέχεται μάλιστα· περιττὴ γὰρ καὶ ἡ διηγηματικὴ μίμησις τῶν ἄλλων\), τὸ δὲ ἰαμβεῖον καὶ τετράμετρον κινητικὰ καὶ τὸ μὲν ὀρχηστικὸν τὸ δὲ πρακτικόν. οἷον ὁ τὰ Κύπρια ποιήσας καὶ τὴν μικρὰν Ἰλιάδα. τοιγαροῦν ἐκ μὲν Ἰλιάδος καὶ Ὀδυσσείας μία τραγῳδία ποιεῖται ἑκατέρας ἢ δύο μόναι, ἐκ δὲ Κυπρίων πολλαὶ καὶ τῆς μικρᾶς Ἰλιάδος \[\[πλέον\] ὀκτώ, οἷον ὅπλων κρίσις, Φιλοκτήτης, Νεοπτόλεμος, Εὐρύπυλος, πτωχεία, Λάκαιναι, Ἰλίου πέρσις καὶ ἀπόπλους \[καὶ Σίνων καὶ Τρῳάδες\]\]. ἔτι δὲ τὰ εἴδη ταὐτὰ δεῖ ἔχειν τὴν ἐποποιίαν τῇ τραγῳδίᾳ, ἢ γὰρ ἁπλῆν ἢ πεπλεγμένην ἢ ἠθικὴν ἢ παθητικήν· καὶ τὰ μέρη ἔξω μελοποιίας καὶ ὄψεως ταὐτά· καὶ γὰρ περιπετειῶν δεῖ καὶ ἀναγνωρίσεων καὶ παθημάτων· ἔτι τὰς διανοίας καὶ τὴν λέξιν ἔχειν καλῶς. οἷς ἅπασιν Ὅμηρος κέχρηται καὶ πρῶτος καὶ ἱκανῶς. καὶ γὰρ τῶν ποιημάτων ἑκάτερον συνέστηκεν ἡ μὲν Ἰλιὰς ἁπλοῦν καὶ παθητικόν, ἡ δὲ Ὀδύσσεια πεπλεγμένον \(ἀναγνώρισις γὰρ διόλου\) καὶ ἠθική· πρὸς δὲ τούτοις λέξει καὶ διανοίᾳ πάντα ὑπερβέβληκεν. διαφέρει δὲ κατά τε τῆς συστάσεως τὸ μῆκος ἡ ἐποποιία καὶ τὸ μέτρον. τοῦ μὲν οὖν μήκους ὅρος ἱκανὸς ὁ εἰρημένος· δύνασθαι γὰρ δεῖ συνορᾶσθαι τὴν ἀρχὴν καὶ τὸ τέλος. εἴη δ᾽ ἂν τοῦτο, εἰ τῶν μὲν ἀρχαίων ἐλάττους αἱ συστάσεις εἶεν, πρὸς δὲ τὸ πλῆθος τραγῳδιῶν τῶν εἰς μίαν ἀκρόασιν τιθεμένων παρήκοιεν. ἔχει δὲ πρὸς τὸ ἐπεκτείνεσθαι τὸ μέγεθος πολύ τι ἡ ἐποποιία ἴδιον διὰ τὸ ἐν μὲν τῇ τραγῳδίᾳ μὴ ἐνδέχεσθαι ἅμα πραττόμενα πολλὰ μέρη μιμεῖσθαι ἀλλὰ τὸ ἐπὶ τῆς σκηνῆς καὶ τῶν ὑποκριτῶν μέρος μόνον· ἐν δὲ τῇ ἐποποιίᾳ διὰ τὸ διήγησιν εἶναι ἔστι πολλὰ μέρη ἅμα ποιεῖν περαινόμενα, ὑφ᾽ ὧν οἰκείων ὄντων αὔξεται ὁ τοῦ ποιήματος ὄγκος. ὥστε τοῦτ᾽ ἔχει τὸ ἀγαθὸν εἰς μεγαλοπρέπειαν καὶ τὸ μεταβάλλειν τὸν ἀκούοντα καὶ ἐπεισοδιοῦν ἀνομοίοις ἐπεισοδίοις· τὸ γὰρ ὅμοιον ταχὺ πληροῦν ἐκπίπτειν ποιεῖ τὰς τραγῳδίας. τὸ δὲ μέτρον τὸ ἡρωικὸν ἀπὸ τῆς πείρας ἥρμοκεν. εἰ γάρ τις ἐν ἄλλῳ τινὶ μέτρῳ διηγηματικὴν μίμησιν ποιοῖτο ἢ ἐν πολλοῖς, ἀπρεπὲς ἂν φαίνοιτο· τὸ γὰρ ἡρωικὸν στασιμώτατον καὶ ὀγκωδέστατον τῶν μέτρων ἐστίν \(διὸ καὶ γλώττας καὶ μεταφορὰς δέχεται μάλιστα· περιττὴ γὰρ καὶ ἡ διηγηματικὴ μίμησις τῶν ἄλλων\), τὸ δὲ ἰαμβεῖον καὶ τετράμετρον κινητικὰ καὶ τὸ μὲν ὀρχηστικὸν τὸ δὲ πρακτικόν. ἔτι δὲ ἀτοπώτερον εἰ μιγνύοι τις αὐτά, ὥσπερ Χαιρήμων. διὸ οὐδεὶς μακρὰν σύστασιν ἐν ἄλλῳ πεποίηκεν ἢ τῷ ἡρῴῳ, ἀλλ᾽ ὥσπερ εἴπομεν αὐτὴ ἡ φύσις διδάσκει τὸ ἁρμόττον αὐτῇ αἱρεῖσθαι.

Ὅμηρος δὲ ἄλλα τε πολλὰ ἄξιος ἐπαινεῖσθαι καὶ δὴ καὶ ὅτι μόνος τῶν ποιητῶν οὐκ ἀγνοεῖ ὃ δεῖ ποιεῖν αὐτόν. αὐτὸν γὰρ δεῖ τὸν ποιητὴν ἐλάχιστα λέγειν· οὐ γάρ ἐστι κατὰ ταῦτα μιμητής. οἱ μὲν οὖν ἄλλοι αὐτοὶ μὲν δι᾽ ὅλου ἀγωνίζονται, μιμοῦνται δὲ ὀλίγα καὶ ὀλιγάκις· ὁ δὲ ὀλίγα φροιμιασάμενος εὐθὺς εἰσάγει ἄνδρα ἢ γυναῖκα ἢ ἄλλο τι ἦθος, καὶ οὐδέν᾽ ἀήθη ἀλλ᾽ ἔχοντα ἦθος.

Δεῖ μὲν οὖν ἐν ταῖς τραγῳδίαις ποιεῖν τὸ θαυμαστόν, μᾶλλον δ᾽ ἐνδέχεται ἐν τῇ ἐποποιίᾳ τὸ ἄλογον, δι᾽ ὃ συμβαίνει μάλιστα τὸ θαυμαστόν, διὰ τὸ μὴ ὁρᾶν εἰς τὸν πράττοντα· ἐπεὶ τὰ περὶ τὴν Ἕκτορος δίωξιν ἐπὶ σκηνῆς ὄντα γελοῖα ἂν φανείη, οἱ μὲν ἑστῶτες καὶ οὐ διώκοντες, ὁ δὲ ἀνανεύων, ἐν δὲ τοῖς ἔπεσιν λανθάνει. τὸ δὲ θαυμαστὸν ἡδύ· σημεῖον δέ, πάντες γὰρ προστιθέντες ἀπαγγέλλουσιν ὡς χαριζόμενοι.

Δεδίδαχεν δὲ μάλιστα Ὅμηρος καὶ τοὺς ἄλλους ψευδῆ λέγειν ὡς δεῖ. ἔστι δὲ τοῦτο παραλογισμός. οἴονται γὰρ οἱ ἄνθρωποι, ὅταν τουδὶ ὄντος τοδὶ ᾖ ἢ γινομένου γίνηται, εἰ τὸ ὕστερον ἔστιν, καὶ τὸ πρότερον εἶναι ἢ γίνεσθαι· τοῦτο δέ ἐστι ψεῦδος. διὸ δεῖ, ἂν τὸ πρῶτον ψεῦδος, ἄλλο δὲ τούτου ὄντος ἀνάγκη εἶναι ἢ γενέσθαι ᾖ, προσθεῖναι· διὰ γὰρ τὸ τοῦτο εἰδέναι ἀληθὲς ὂν παραλογίζεται ἡμῶν ἡ ψυχὴ καὶ τὸ πρῶτον ὡς ὄν. παράδειγμα δὲ τούτου τὸ ἐκ τῶν Νίπτρων.

Προαιρεῖσθαί τε δεῖ ἀδύνατα εἰκότα μᾶλλον ἢ δυνατὰ ἀπίθανα· τούς τε λόγους μὴ συνίστασθαι ἐκ μερῶν ἀλόγων, ἀλλὰ μάλιστα μὲν μηδὲν ἔχειν ἄλογον, εἰ δὲ μή, ἔξω τοῦ μυθεύματος, ὥσπερ Οἰδίπους τὸ μὴ εἰδέναι πῶς ὁ Λάιος ἀπέθανεν, ἀλλὰ μὴ ἐν τῷ δράματι, ὥσπερ ἐν Ἠλέκτρᾳ οἱ τὰ Πύθια ἀπαγγέλλοντες ἢ ἐν Μυσοῖς ὁ ἄφωνος ἐκ Τεγέας εἰς τὴν Μυσίαν ἥκων. ὥστε τὸ λέγειν ὅτι ἀνῄρητο ἂν ὁ μῦθος γελοῖον· ἐξ ἀρχῆς γὰρ οὐ δεῖ συνίστασθαι τοιούτους. ἂν δὲ θῇ καὶ φαίνηται εὐλογωτέρως ἐνδέχεσθαι καὶ ἄτοπον. ἐπεὶ καὶ τὰ ἐν Ὀδυσσείᾳ ἄλογα τὰ περὶ τὴν ἔκθεσιν ὡς οὐκ ἂν ἦν ἀνεκτὰ δῆλον ἂν γένοιτο, εἰ αὐτὰ φαῦλος ποιητὴς ποιήσειε· νῦν δὲ τοῖς ἄλλοις ἀγαθοῖς ὁ ποιητὴς ἀφανίζει ἡδύνων τὸ ἄτοπον.

Τῇ δὲ λέξει δεῖ διαπονεῖν ἐν τοῖς ἀργοῖς μέρεσιν καὶ μήτε ἠθικοῖς μήτε διανοητικοῖς· ἀποκρύπτει γὰρ πάλιν ἡ λίαν λαμπρὰ λέξις τά τε ἤθη καὶ τὰς διανοίας.



 

25. Περὶ δὲ προβλημάτων καὶ λύσεων, ἐκ πόσων τε καὶ ποίων εἰδῶν ἐστιν, ὧδ᾽ ἂν θεωροῦσιν γένοιτ᾽ ἂν φανερόν.

Ἔπεὶ γάρ ἐστι μιμητὴς ὁ ποιητὴς ὡσπερανεὶ ζωγράφος ἤ τις ἄλλος εἰκονοποιός, ἀνάγκη μιμεῖσθαι τριῶν ὄντων τὸν ἀριθμὸν ἕν τι ἀεί, ἢ γὰρ οἷα ἦν ἢ ἔστιν, ἢ οἷά φασιν καὶ δοκεῖ, ἢ οἷα εἶναι δεῖ. ταῦτα δ᾽ ἐξαγγέλλεται λέξει ἐν ᾗ καὶ γλῶτται καὶ μεταφοραὶ καὶ πολλὰ πάθη τῆς λέξεώς ἐστι· δίδομεν γὰρ ταῦτα τοῖς ποιηταῖς.

Πρὸς δὲ τούτοις οὐχ ἡ αὐτὴ ὀρθότης ἐστὶν τῆς πολιτικῆς καὶ τῆς ποιητικῆς οὐδὲ ἄλλης τέχνης καὶ ποιητικῆς. αὐτῆς δὲ τῆς ποιητικῆς διττὴ ἁμαρτία, ἡ μὲν γὰρ καθ᾽ αὑτήν, ἡ δὲ κατὰ συμβεβηκός. εἰ μὲν γὰρ προείλετο μιμήσασθαι … ἀδυναμίαν, αὐτῆς ἡ ἁμαρτία· εἰ δὲ τὸ προελέσθαι μὴ ὀρθῶς, ἀλλὰ τὸν ἵππον <ἅμ᾽> ἄμφω τὰ δεξιὰ προβεβληκότα, ἢ τὸ καθ᾽ ἑκάστην τέχνην ἁμάρτημα, οἷον τὸ κατ᾽ ἰατρικὴν ἢ ἄλλην τέχνην \[ἢ ἀδύνατα πεποίηται\] ὁποιανοῦν, οὐ καθ᾽ ἑαυτήν. ὥστε δεῖ τὰ ἐπιτιμήματα ἐν τοῖς προβλήμασιν ἐκ τούτων ἐπισκοποῦντα λύειν.

Πρῶτον μὲν τὰ πρὸς αὐτὴν τὴν τέχνην· ἀδύνατα πεποίηται, ἡμάρτηται· ἀλλ᾽ ὀρθῶς ἔχει, εἰ τυγχάνει τοῦ τέλους τοῦ αὑτῆς \(τὸ γὰρ τέλος εἴρηται\), εἰ οὕτως ἐκπληκτικώτερον ἢ αὐτὸ ἢ ἄλλο ποιεῖ μέρος. παράδειγμα ἡ τοῦ Ἕκτορος δίωξις. Εἰ μέντοι τὸ τέλος ἢ μᾶλλον ἢ <μὴ> ἧττον ἐνεδέχετο ὑπάρχειν καὶ κατὰ τὴν περὶ τούτων τέχνην, \[ἡμαρτῆσθαι\] οὐκ ὀρθῶς· δεῖ γὰρ εἰ ἐνδέχεται ὅλως μηδαμῇ ἡμαρτῆσθαι. ἔτι ποτέρων ἐστὶ τὸ ἁμάρτημα, τῶν κατὰ τὴν τέχνην ἢ κατ᾽ ἄλλο συμβεβηκός; ἔλαττον γὰρ εἰ μὴ ᾔδει ὅτι ἔλαφος θήλεια κέρατα οὐκ ἔχει ἢ εἰ ἀμιμήτως ἔγραψεν.

Πρὸς δὲ τούτοις ἐὰν ἐπιτιμᾶται ὅτι οὐκ ἀληθῆ, ἀλλ᾽ ἴσως <ὡς> δεῖ, οἷον καὶ Σοφοκλῆς ἔφη αὐτὸς μὲν οἵους δεῖ ποιεῖν, Εὐριπίδην δὲ οἷοι εἰσίν, ταύτῃ λυτέον. εἰ δὲ μηδετέρως, ὅτι οὕτω φασίν, οἷον τὰ περὶ θεῶν· ἴσως γὰρ οὔτε βέλτιον οὕτω λέγειν οὔτ᾽ ἀληθῆ, ἀλλ᾽ εἰ ἔτυχεν ὥσπερ Ξενοφάνει· ἀλλ᾽ οὖν φασι. τὰ δὲ ἴσως οὐ βέλτιον μέν, ἀλλ᾽ οὕτως εἶχεν, οἷον τὰ περὶ τῶν ὅπλων, ‘ἔγχεα δέ σφιν ὄρθ᾽ ἐπὶ σαυρωτῆρος’· οὕτω γὰρ τότ᾽ ἐνόμιζον, ὥσπερ καὶ νῦν Ἰλλυριοί.

Περὶ δὲ τοῦ καλῶς ἢ μὴ καλῶς εἰ εἴρηταί τινι ἢ πέπρακται, οὐ μόνον σκεπτέον εἰς αὐτὸ τὸ πεπραγμένον ἢ εἰρημένον βλέποντα εἰ σπουδαῖον ἢ φαῦλον, ἀλλὰ καὶ εἰς τὸν πράττοντα ἢ λέγοντα πρὸς ὃν ἢ ὅτε ἢ ὅτῳ ἢ οὗ ἕνεκεν, οἷον εἰ μείζονος ἀγαθοῦ, ἵνα γένηται, ἢ μείζονος κακοῦ, ἵνα ἀπογένηται.

Τὰ δὲ πρὸς τὴν λέξιν ὁρῶντα δεῖ διαλύειν, οἷον γλώττῃ τὸ ‘οὐρῆας μὲν πρῶτον’· ἴσως γὰρ οὐ τοὺς ἡμιόνους λέγει ἀλλὰ τοὺς φύλακας· καὶ τὸν Δόλωνα, ‘ὅς ῥ᾽ ἦ τοι εἶδος μὲν ἔην κακός’, οὐ τὸ σῶμα ἀσύμμετρον ἀλλὰ τὸ πρόσωπον αἰσχρόν, τὸ γὰρ εὐειδὲς οἱ Κρῆτες τὸ εὐπρόσωπον καλοῦσι· καὶ τὸ ‘ζωρότερον δὲ κέραιε ’οὐ τὸ ἄκρατον ὡς οἰνόφλυξιν ἀλλὰ τὸ θᾶττον. τὸ δὲ κατὰ μεταφορὰν εἴρηται, οἷον ‘πάντες μέν ῥα θεοί τε καὶ ἀνέρες εὗδον παννύχιοι’· ἅμα δέ φησιν ‘ἦ τοι ὅτ᾽ ἐς πεδίον τὸ Τρωικὸν ἀθρήσειεν, αὐλῶν συρίγγων τε ὅμαδον’· τὸ γὰρ ‘πάντες’ ἀντὶ τοῦ πολλοί κατὰ μεταφορὰν εἴρηται, τὸ γὰρ πᾶν πολύ τι. καὶ τὸ ‘οἴη δ᾽ ἄμμορος’ κατὰ μεταφοράν, τὸ γὰρ γνωριμώτατον μόνον.

Κατὰ δὲ προσῳδίαν, ὥσπερ Ἱππίας ἔλυεν ὁ Θάσιος, τὸ ‘δίδομεν δέ οἱ εὖχος ἀρέσθαι’ καὶ ‘τὸ μὲν οὗ καταπύθεται ὄμβρῳ’. τὰ δὲ διαιρέσει, οἷον Ἐμπεδοκλῆς ‘αἶψα δὲ θνήτ᾽ ἐφύοντο τὰ πρὶν μάθον ἀθάνατ᾽ εἶναι ζωρά τε πρὶν κέκρητο’. τὰ δὲ ἀμφιβολίᾳ, ‘παρῴχηκεν δὲ πλέω νύξ’· τὸ γὰρ πλείω ἀμφίβολόν ἐστιν. τὰ δὲ κατὰ τὸ ἔθος τῆς λέξεως. τὸν κεκραμένον οἶνόν φασιν εἶναι, ὅθεν πεποίηται ‘κνημὶς νεοτεύκτου κασσιτέροιο’· καὶ χαλκέας τοὺς τὸν σίδηρον ἐργαζομένους, ὅθεν εἴρηται ὁ Γανυμήδης ‘Διὶ οἰνοχοεύειν’, οὐ πινόντων οἶνον. εἴη δ᾽ ἂν τοῦτό γε <καὶ> κατὰ μεταφοράν.

Δεῖ δὲ καὶ ὅταν ὄνομά τι ὑπεναντίωμά τι δοκῇ σημαίνειν, ἐπισκοπεῖν ποσαχῶς ἂν σημήνειε τοῦτο ἐν τῷ εἰρημένῳ, οἷον τῷ ‘τῇ ῥ᾽ ἔσχετο χάλκεον ἔγχος’ τὸ ταύτῃ κωλυθῆναι ποσαχῶς ἐνδέχεται, ὡδὶ ἢ ὡδί, ὡς μάλιστ᾽ ἄν τις ὑπολάβοι· κατὰ τὴν καταντικρὺ ἢ ὡς Γλαύκων λέγει, ὅτι ἔνιοι ἀλόγως προϋπολαμβάνουσί τι καὶ αὐτοὶ καταψηφισάμενοι συλλογίζονται, καὶ ὡς εἰρηκότος ὅ τι δοκεῖ ἐπιτιμῶσιν, ἂν ὑπεναντίον ᾖ τῇ αὑτῶν οἰήσει. τοῦτο δὲ πέπονθε τὰ περὶ Ἰκάριον. οἴονται γὰρ αὐτὸν Λάκωνα εἶναι· ἄτοπον οὖν τὸ μὴ ἐντυχεῖν τὸν Τηλέμαχον αὐτῷ εἰς Λακεδαίμονα ἐλθόντα. τὸ δ᾽ ἴσως ἔχει ὥσπερ οἱ Κεφαλλῆνές φασι· παρ᾽ αὑτῶν γὰρ γῆμαι λέγουσι τὸν Ὀδυσσέα καὶ εἶναι Ἰκάδιον ἀλλ᾽ οὐκ Ἰκάριον· δι᾽ ἁμάρτημα δὲ τὸ πρόβλημα εἰκός ἐστιν.

Ὅλως δὲ τὸ ἀδύνατον μὲν πρὸς τὴν ποίησιν ἢ πρὸς τὸ βέλτιον ἢ πρὸς τὴν δόξαν δεῖ ἀνάγειν. πρός τε γὰρ τὴν ποίησιν αἱρετώτερον πιθανὸν ἀδύνατον ἢ ἀπίθανον καὶ δυνατόν· … τοιούτους εἶναι οἷον Ζεῦξις ἔγραφεν, ἀλλὰ βέλτιον· τὸ γὰρ παράδειγμα δεῖ ὑπερέχειν. πρὸς ἅ φασιν τἄλογα· οὕτω τε καὶ ὅτι ποτὲ οὐκ ἄλογόν ἐστιν· εἰκὸς γὰρ καὶ παρὰ τὸ εἰκὸς γίνεσθαι. τὰ δ᾽ ὑπεναντίως εἰρημένα οὕτω σκοπεῖν ὥσπερ οἱ ἐν τοῖς λόγοις ἔλεγχοι εἰ τὸ αὐτὸ καὶ πρὸς τὸ αὐτὸ καὶ ὡσαύτως, ὥστε καὶ αὐτὸν ἢ πρὸς ἃ αὐτὸς λέγει ἢ ὃ ἂν φρόνιμος ὑποθῆται. ὀρθὴ δ᾽ ἐπιτίμησις καὶ ἀλογίᾳ καὶ μοχθηρίᾳ, ὅταν μὴ ἀνάγκης οὔσης μηθὲν χρήσηται τῷ ἀλόγῳ, ὥσπερ Εὐριπίδης τῷ Αἰγεῖ, ἢ τῇ πονηρίᾳ, ὥσπερ ἐν Ὀρέστῃ <τῇ> τοῦ Μενελάου.

Τὰ μὲν οὖν ἐπιτιμήματα ἐκ πέντε εἰδῶν φέρουσιν· ἢ γὰρ ὡς ἀδύνατα ἢ ὡς ἄλογα ἢ ὡς βλαβερὰ ἢ ὡς ὑπεναντία ἢ ὡς παρὰ τὴν ὀρθότητα τὴν κατὰ τέχνην. αἱ δὲ λύσεις ἐκ τῶν εἰρημένων ἀριθμῶν σκεπτέαι. εἰσὶν δὲ δώδεκα.





 

26. Πότερον δὲ βελτίων ἡ ἐποποιικὴ μίμησις ἢ ἡ τραγική, διαπορήσειεν ἄν τις.

# NOTES



1. 
1.     Aristotle here and throughout the book uses the words *poiêtikê* \(poetry\) and *poiêtês* \(creator, maker, poet\). These words can be limiting to modern readers since they have a more restricted use in our culture than in ancient Greece, where the medium for the presentation of most stories, including drama, comedy, and epic, was poetic verse, often accompanied by music. Although I will often use the words *poetry* and *poet* in my translation, we should keep in mind that they mean much more than we are accustomed to.

2. 
2.     Such as the *Iliad* and *Odyssey* of Homer.

3. 
3.     Tragic drama such as *Oedipus Rex* by Sophocles or the plays of Aeschylus.

4. 
4.     A *dithyramb* was a song sung by a chorus, originally in honor of the god Dionysus.

5. 
5.     Greek *mimêsis*, a key concept for Aristotle’s idea of storytelling.

6. 
6.     The *syrinx*, a simple kind of musical pipes.

7. 
7.     For the word lacking in Greek we would use *literature*, encompassing both prose and poetry.

8. 
8.     Sophron and Xenarchus were father and son writers of comic sketches in prose about everyday life. They lived in fifth-century Sicily, which had many Greek towns. The prose dialogues featuring Socrates as a main character were written by Plato, Aristotle’s teacher, in the fourth century BCE. Iambic trimeter was a poetic meter used in the dialogues of Greek drama, as well as in other types of poetry. Elegiac couplets, a Greek verse type most famously composed by Theognis of Megara in the sixth century BCE, could be used for war songs, erotic poems, or other kinds of verse.

9. 
9.     Empedocles was a fifth-century Sicilian Greek who wrote two philosophical and scientific works, *On Nature* and *Purifications*, in hexameters, the same poetic meter Homer used.

10. 
10.   Chaeremon was a fourth-century writer of tragic drama probably meant for recitation rather than production on a stage.

11. 
11.   *Nomes*, like dithyrambs, were choral songs.

12. 
12.   Polygnotus was a famous fifth-century painter. We know almost nothing about Pauson or Dionysius.

13. 
13.   Cleophon was a minor writer of tragedy.

14. 
14.   Hegemon lived in the fifth century and wrote epic burlesque. Nicochares was his contemporary and was a comic poet \(*Deiliad* means “coward tale” and is a play on the title of Homer’s *Iliad*\).

15. 
15.   Both innovative poets of the late fifth and early fourth centuries. A *Cyclops* \(plural *Cyclopes*\) was an ill-tempered, one-eyed giant of Greek mythology. It isn’t clear exactly what point Aristotle is making in this sentence.

16. 
16.   Homer uses both straight narration, with no direct speech, and dialogue, in which the characters speak in their own voices.

17. 
17.   Aristophanes, the author of biting satires such as *Lysistrata* and *The Clouds*, was the greatest comedy writer for the stage in fifth-century Athens.

18. 
18.   The Greek noun *drama* comes from the verb *dran* \(to do or act\).

19. 
19.   The Dorians were a subgroup of the Greeks who lived mostly in the Peloponnese in southern Greece and spoke a different Greek dialect from that of the Athenians. The most famous city of the Dorians was Sparta, but Megara, just to the west of Athens, was also Dorian.

20. 
20.   In the early to mid-sixth century, before comedy was introduced into the dramatic festivals at Athens.

21. 
21.   Epicharmus was born in Sicily, though he may not have been from a Megarian colony, and probably flourished in the late sixth and early fifth centuries. Chionides and Magnes wrote comedies in Athens in the 480s and 470s.

22. 
22.   The Greek historian Herodotus \(*History* 5.67\) says tragic choruses performed in the early sixth-century Dorian city of Sicyon in the northern Peloponnese.

23. 
23.   This sounds a little less pretentious when we remember that the Greek word for *philosopher* means “someone who loves wisdom.”

24. 
24.   The *Margites* is a comic epic about a foolish man of the same name and his ridiculous misadventures, especially on his wedding night. It is preserved only in a few fragments, but many critics ancient and modern do not believe it was composed by Homer.

25. 
25.   An *iamb* as a poetic unit is a short syllable followed by a long syllable, forming one metrical foot. The verb *iambazein* means “to satirize.”

26. 
26.   That is, dramatic presentations as we know them were born when leaders of these choruses stepped forth from the group to give individual performances, whether in serious religious choruses that performed dithyrambs or in obscene performances in which the choral members carried phallic icons in honor of the god Dionysus.

27. 
27.   Aeschylus \(ca. 525–456\) was the earliest of the great tragic dramatists of fifth-century Athens. Some of his best-known works are *Seven against Thebes* and the *Oresteia* trilogy.

28. 
28.   Sophocles \(ca. 497–405\) was the celebrated author of *Oedipus Rex* and other plays.

29. 
29.   Satyr plays were burlesque productions with lustful, drunken, half-human satyrs as the chorus. Older and preserving some earlier elements of tragedy according to Aristotle, they were still produced in fifth-century Athens along with tragedies as part of dramatic festivals. The longer trochaic tetrameter, with four poetic measures to a line, was apparently the main meter of early tragedy, which in time gave way to the shorter iambic trimeter, with three measures to each line.

30. 
30.   A hexameter has six poetic feet to a line.

31. 
31.   These were the spoken parts of the play that came between choral odes.

32. 
32.   Greek actors wore masks that reflected the qualities of the character they played.

33. 
33.   The archon was an Athenian public official who chose which plays to produce and fund from the public treasury. This first happened for comedy in 487, but earlier for tragedy.

34. 
34.   Crates was an actor before he turned comic writer, sometime around 450. His plays don’t survive, but we know one was about a group of animals who decided they didn’t want to be eaten by people.

35. 
35.   Greek epic poetry, such as Homer’s *Iliad* and *Odyssey*, was composed only in dactylic hexameter, i.e., six dactyl feet.

36. 
36.   One of the most famous statements in the *Poetics*. Aristotle means that an audience watching the best tragic story will be moved by *pity* \(“That poor person\!”\) and *fear* \(“Oh no, that might have happened to me”\). The Greek word *catharsis* literally means “a cleansing.”

37. 
37.   For Polygnotus, see note 12 above. Zeuxis painted in the late fifth/early fourth centuries and was known for his idealism in portraits.

38. 
38.   That is, we can be deeply moved by simply reading a play and not seeing it onstage.

39. 
39.   The Greek word *skeuopoios*, which I have translated as “producer,” could also refer to a costumer, stage carpenter, or property manager.

40. 
40.   Greeks and Romans measured time by using a water clock \(*klepsydra*\) from which water dripped at a steady rate. Which performances in the past Aristotle is referring to here is unknown.

41. 
41.   Hercules \(Greek *Heracles*\) was the great hero of Greek mythology who battled monsters and performed twelve celebrated labors. Theseus was the mythological king of Athens who slew the Minotaur in the Cretan labyrinth with the help of Ariadne.

42. 
42.   As a young man Odysseus was wounded in a boar hunt on Mount Parnassus in central Greece, then he later tried to avoid service in the Trojan War by pretending to be insane. Although the former actually does come up as a flashback in the *Odyssey* \(19.392–466\), Aristotle’s point is that neither of these episodes is part of the unified plot of the *Odyssey*.

43. 
43.   The fifth-century Greek historian wrote a history of the Persian War.

44. 
44.   An Athenian politician and general who switched sides during the Peloponnesian War.

45. 
45.   That is, traditional characters such as Oedipus or Odysseus, whose tales were seen by many to be at least semihistorical.

46. 
46.   Agathon was a successful writer of tragedies in late fifth-century Athens. His play *Antheus* does not survive.

47. 
47.   Aristotle is playing on words in Greek. Literally he says: “It is clear that a *poiêtês* \(poet\) should be a *poiêtês* \(maker\) of plots more than of verses,” with *poiêtês* meaning both “poet” and “maker” in Greek.

48. 
48.   Argos was an important town in southern Greece. We know almost nothing about Mitys or this story, but Aristotle’s point is that sometimes things that seem to happen by chance are so appropriate that we believe there is a controlling purpose behind them.

49. 
49.   As in the classic fallacy *post hoc ergo propter hoc* \(after which therefore because of which\), the assertion that an event \(B\) happening after an earlier event \(A\) must have been caused by that event \(e.g., “I washed my car, then it rained. Therefore washing my car caused it to rain.”\).

50. 
50.   A reversal \(Greek *peripeteia*\) is stronger than a simple change of fortune over time. As in the example of Oedipus below, it is sudden and sharp, though always necessary or at least probable in the logic of the story line.

51. 
51.   *Oedipus Rex* by the fifth-century Athenian playwright Sophocles is Aristotle’s example of a tragedy par excellence. In the play, Oedipus has fled the city of Corinth after hearing a prophecy that he will kill his father and marry his mother. He believes he has left behind his parents in Corinth and thus escaped his terrible fate. On his way to his new home in Thebes he kills a man in a quarrel, then marries the newly widowed queen of Thebes. But as he discovers from the messenger, he was adopted by a couple in Corinth as a baby. He begins to realize that his real father was in fact the man he had murdered on the road and the widow he married and had children with in Thebes is in fact his birth mother.

52. 
52.   *Lynceus* was probably written by Aristotle’s friend Theodectes. We know little about the lost play, but it was based on the myth of Danaus, who orders his fifty daughters to kill their husbands on their common wedding night. Hypermnestra alone spares her husband, Lynceus, and hides him, but Danaus apparently discovers the truth and brings about the events here, though how the reversal in plot occurs we don’t know.

53. 
53.   Greek *anagnôrisis*, which, like English *re-cognition*, means to rediscover or remember something from the past.

54. 
54.   From *Iphigenia at Aulis* by the fifth-century playwright Euripides. Orestes goes to the distant land of Tauris and there finds his sister Iphigenia, whom he recognizes when she recites a letter she has prepared to send home to Greece. After this Orestes reveals details of her past that convince Iphigenia that he is indeed her brother.

55. 
55.   This short chapter seems rather out of place for the flow of Aristotle’s argument, so much so that some scholars have considered it transposed from another place in the book or even a later addition by another author.

56. 
56.   The metrical rhythms of trochees and anapests are more common in the *parados* than the *stasimon*.

57. 
57.   Since this is where most of us would place ourselves, we can identify best with this kind of character and thus feel pity and fear when they fall.

58. 
58.   Greek *hamartia*, a tragic error or moral weakness that causes a person to fall into misery and misfortune. In origin a term meaning to miss the target when throwing a spear, it was later used by Greek Christian writers for the idea of sin.

59. 
59.   A king of Mycenae who was tricked by his brother Atreus into eating his own children.

60. 
60.   All these characters, some of whom were mentioned earlier, committed or caused violence against their family members. Alcmaeon killed his mother after she betrayed him, Meleager and Telephus each killed his own uncle.

61. 
61.   In Homer’s *Odyssey*, the first part of the story line separately follows Odysseus on his journey home to Ithaca and the events in Ithaca and elsewhere with his son, Telemachus, and wife, Penelope. Halfway through the book, Odysseus returns to Ithaca then defeats and slays the wicked suitors who have tried to kill his son, marry Penelope, and take over his kingdom.

62. 
62.   Aegisthus was the lover of Orestes’s mother, Clytemnestra, with whom he plotted to murder Orestes’s father, Agamemnon, when he returned from the Trojan War. In the tragic tradition, Orestes kills Aegisthus and Clytemnestra in revenge for his father’s death. Aristotle is imagining a burlesque comedy in which the play ends very differently.

63. 
63.   Aristotle here uses the Greek word *philoi*, which means those with whom you have a close relationship, either by friendship or by family ties.

64. 
64.   Some versions of the story say Alcmaeon killed his mother, Eriphyle, by accident, but others say it was in revenge for the death of his father, Amphiaraus.

65. 
65.   Euripides tells the traditional story of Medea, who, after being abandoned by Jason for another woman, kills their children \(along with the new woman and her father\) to ruin Jason’s life.

66. 
66.   Astydamas was the younger of a father-son pair of fourth-century tragedy writers. *Odysseus Wounded* is a lost play of Sophocles in which Odysseus is unwittingly killed by Telegonus, his own son by the witch Circe.

67. 
67.   In Sophocles’s *Antigone*, Haemon threatens to kill his father, Creon, who condemns Haemon’s fiancée, Antigone, to death, but Haemon doesn’t carry out the murder.

68. 
68.   In Euripides’s lost play *Cresphontes*, Merope is about to kill her son in his sleep after many years apart when she realizes who he is. *Iphigenia* is discussed in note 54 above, but we know nothing about the *Helle*. Some readers of the *Poetics* have argued that Aristotle’s supposed best option doesn’t make a great deal of sense given what he’s just said.

69. 
69.   Like all Greek men of his time, Aristotle thought women had a proper place in society, but were by nature inferior to men.

70. 
70.   It’s not certain what earlier passage Aristotle is referring to. *Relatability* here is a translation of the Greek word *homoios*, meaning “like, similar to, resembling.” Aristotle means we must be able to relate to and be connected to characters.

71. 
71.   A play by Euripides in which Menelaus, the husband of Helen and brother of Agamemnon, fails to support his nephew Orestes.

72. 
72.   *Scylla* is a choral song by Timotheus in which Odysseus laments the loss of his friends who have been eaten by the monster Scylla. *Melanippe the Wise* is a lost play by Euripides in which the maiden Melanippe gives birth to twins by the god Poseidon, then abandons them until they are found and nursed by a cow. Melanippe’s father discovers them and assumes that the cow had somehow unnaturally given birth to human twins, but Melanippe uses scientific arguments—inappropriate to a woman in Aristotle’s view—to prove this is impossible.

73. 
73.   In the Euripides play, when Iphigenia first learns she is going to be sacrificed to help the Greek army reach Troy, she begs for her life. At the end of the drama, she embraces her fate.

74. 
74.   The Greek phrase *apo mechanês* \(Latin *deus ex machina*\) comes from a machine like a crane that was used to lower a god onto the stage. In can also be used in a broader sense for a supernatural intervention in a story to solve a plot problem. In *Medea* the chariot of the sun god comes to whisk Medea away to Athens, while in the *Iliad* \(book 2\) the Greeks are ready to flee the Trojan shores until Athena stops their panic.

75. 
75.   Regarding the ignorance of Oedipus about the death of his father, Laius.

76. 
76.   In Homer’s *Iliad*, Achilles makes the mistake of being stubborn beyond reason. This eventually causes great heartache for him when his best friend, Patroclus, dies because of his unyielding anger at his fellow Greeks.

77. 
77.   Presumably Aristotle’s lost work *On Poets*.

78. 
78.   The quotation is from an unknown tragedy referring to the men who grew from the earth after Cadmus sowed dragon’s teeth in the ground to populate his new town of Thebes. Carcinus was a writer of tragedies from the early fourth-century, but we know nothing about this play.

79. 
79.   Tyro has twin sons by Poseidon in Sophocles’s lost play *Tyro*. She sets them adrift as infants in a boat but later recognizes them from the same boat.

80. 
80.   The nurse Eurycleia discovers the scar while washing the feet of Odysseus, but Odysseus himself shows it to the swineherds as proof of his identity.

81. 
81.   As seen earlier, in Euripides’s *Iphigenia at Aulis* the identity of Iphigenia is revealed when she asks the two strangers to deliver a letter to her brother, Orestes, only to have one of the strangers reveal he is in fact Orestes.

82. 
82.   Tereus is married to Procne when he rapes her sister, Philomela. To keep Philomela quiet, he cuts out her tongue, but she weaves a tapestry for her sister showing what Tereus did. This is the “voice of the shuttle”—a shuttle being a tool for holding thread used in weaving.

83. 
83.   Dicaeogenes was a fifth-century writer of tragedy, but nothing is known of this play. In the *Odyssey*, Odysseus weeps when the bard Demodocus sings about the fall of Troy, prompting his host Alcinous to ask who he is.

84. 
84.   In the *Libation Bearers* \(*Choephori*\) of Aeschylus, Electra finds a lock of hair and footprint at her father’s grave and infers they must belong to Orestes since they are so similar to her own.

85. 
85.   We know nothing of Polyidus or *The Sons of Phineus*. Aristotle has mentioned his friend Tydeus above, but we know nothing of the play of Tydeus.

86. 
86.   This tragedy is lost but was apparently related to the contest of the bow in *Odyssey* \(book 21\). The Greek of this paragraph is unclear.

87. 
87.   Both the writer and the story are unknown.

88. 
88.   Iphigenia tells the king that she needs a ship to purify Orestes and his companion in the sea before killing them, but they use the opportunity to escape.

89. 
89.   In Greek the respective words are *desis* \(knot\) and *lusis* \(untying\).

90. 
90.   See page 69 in section 11 above. The Greek text here is uncertain.

91. 
91.   There are several problems with this passage, not least of which is that the types of tragedy here don’t clearly match anything Aristotle has mentioned earlier in the *Poetics*. There are also textual problems in the surviving Greek manuscripts.

92. 
92.   Ajax was a Greek warrior at Troy who committed suicide, while Ixion was a Greek king punished by Zeus by being bound to a burning wheel for eternity.

93. 
93.   *Women of Phthia* may be a lost play of Sophocles. Both Sophocles and Euripides wrote plays about Peleus, father of Achilles.

94. 
94.   Aristotle may be referring here to plays of Aeschylus.

95. 
95.   Euripides dramatized only small parts of the fall of Troy in the *Trojan Women* and *Hecuba*. We don’t know anything about Aeschylus’s story of Niobe.

96. 
96.   Sisyphus was a cruel king of Corinth whom Zeus punished by forcing him to push a boulder uphill for eternity, only to have it roll back down again. The exact meaning of much of this paragraph is unclear.

97. 
97.   Aristotle would view delivery of the actual line of a drama on the stage as belonging to the acting and vocal training, not something literary critics—who are more likely to *read* drama—would necessarily be interested in.

98. 
98.   Ancient Greek had an active pitch accent system, in which a vowel could rise \(acute accent ´\), fall \(grave accent \`\), or rise then fall \(circumflex accent ∩\).

99. 
99.   The Greek text here is particularly uncertain.

100. 
100. Connective particles such as this are common in ancient Greek.

101. 
101. This phrase is repeated again immediately after, but I have omitted the second occurrence as a likely textual error.

102. 
102. The different parts of compound nouns may not have functional meaning by themselves when separated, but of course they have etymological meaning, as in *theo-* \(god\) and *-dorus* \(gift\).

103. 
103. An example of the first type in English would be *unwelcome* \(where *un* by itself is just a prefix\) and, of the second type, *weekend* \(where both *week* and *end* have meaning separately\).

104. 
104. Massalia was founded from the Greek city of Phocaea in Asia Minor, a region that had three rivers called the *Hermus*, *Caïcus*, and *Xanthus*, from which this triple noun is formed.

105. 
105. Homer, *Odyssey* 1.185.

106. 
106. Empedocles was a fifth-century Greek philosopher and poet from Sicily best known for originating the idea of the four classical elements \(air, water, earth, and fire\).

107. 
107. There is a gap here in the Greek text.

108. 
108. This is true in ancient Greek, but also in other languages such as Latin.

109. 
109. Sthenelus was a tragedian of the fifth century.

110. 
110. This refers to the ancient Greek medical practice of cupping \(placing a heated bronze cup on a wound\).

111. 
111. This is common in ancient Greek poetics, in which meter is based on the metrical length of the syllables in a word, but difficult to explain in many modern languages. The best analogy is making a word longer than normal in the line of a song to have it fit the musical pattern.

112. 
112. This is an attempt to represent in English what the unknown Eucleides is doing in Greek when he unnaturally lengthens syllables to fit the dactylic hexameter rhythm used by Homer. Hellebore was a drug used for mental disorders.

113. 
113. Fragmentary lines from both playwrights.

114. 
114. From Homer’s *Odyssey* \(9.515\), in which the Cyclops describes Odysseus. These English translations of course can’t do justice to the Greek.

115. 
115. Homer, *Odyssey* 20.259.

116. 
116. Homer, *Odyssey* 17.265.

117. 
117. The identity of this critic is not known for certain, but the comic writer Aristophanes mentions the name several times.

118. 
118. Herodotus \(*History* 7.166\) says the naval victory of the Athenians over the Persians at Salamis near Athens and the victory of the Sicilian Greeks over the Carthaginians at Himera in Sicily happened on the same day.

119. 
119. The catalogue of ships section of the *Iliad* \(2.484–779\) lists all the Greeks and their allies who came to fight at Troy and allows the poet to go back to the beginning of the war.

120. 
120. Not composed by Homer, the *Cypria* recounts incidents leading up to the Trojan War, while the *Little Iliad* covers the period immediately after the *Iliad* ends.

121. 
121. *The Judgment of Arms* \(Aeschylus—on the awarding of Achilles’s weapons to Odysseus rather than Ajax\); *Philoctetes* \(Sophocles—on bringing the abandoned hero Philoctetes from Lemnos to Troy\); *Neoptolemus* \(the son of Achilles brought to Troy after his father’s death\); *Eurypylus* \(an ally of the Trojans killed by Neoptolemus\); *Odysseus the Beggar* \(who enters Troy disguised as a beggar\); *The Spartan Women* \(Sophocles—on Helen helping Odysseus and Diomedes inside Troy\); *The Sack of Troy*, *The Departure of the Greek Fleet*, and *Sinon* \(Sophocles—on the Greek who tricked the Trojans into allowing the wooden horse into the city\); and *The Trojan Women* \(Euripides—on the fate of the women captured at Troy\). Most of these plays do not survive.

122. 
122. Both have shorter, quicker lines than the longer dactylic hexameter of epic.

123. 
123. *Iliad*, book 22.

124. 
124. Although this may seem obscure, Aristotle is presenting a very simple and useful plot device in storytelling in which a character falsely assumes some earlier event must have happened because they see the logical result. For example, a husband sees his wife kissing another man as the man leaves their home \(B\), therefore his wife must be having an affair with the man \(A\). In the *Odyssey* bath scene, he probably means that Penelope assumes that if the supposed Cretan stranger \(the disguised Odysseus\) is able to describe Odysseus, he must have seen him earlier in Crete.

125. 
125. *Odyssey*, book 19.

126. 
126. One of the more famous statements of the *Poetics*. Another way of translating the Greek would be: “Probable impossibilities are preferable to implausible possibilities.”

127. 
127. There is a false report of Orestes’s death at the Pythian Games in the play, but this is anachronistic since the games were founded later. In the *Mysians*, by either Aeschylus or Sophocles, Telephus has blood guilt because he killed his uncle and cannot speak to anyone on his journey.

128. 
128. In the *Odyssey*, the Phaeacians bring Odysseus home to Ithaca by ship in a miraculously short time and put him onshore without waking him.

129. 
129. Problems in the Greek text make it uncertain what Aristotle is trying to say here.

130. 
130. Xenophanes was a sixth/fifth century poet and philosopher who criticized authors for portraying the gods with human faults.

131. 
131. *Iliad* 10.152. The Illyrians were a non-Greek people who lived in the western Balkans in ancient times.

132. 
132. *Iliad* 1.50. After all, it seems silly that Apollo would particularly target the mules.

133. 
133. *Iliad* 10.316. Elsewhere Homer says that Dolon is a swift runner, which presumably he couldn’t be if his body were misshapen.

134. 
134. Achilles says this to his companion Patroclus when the Greek envoys come to his tent \(*Iliad* 9.202\). Greeks normally drank their wine mixed with water.

135. 
135. Aristotle is garbling Homeric passages here, but his point remains valid.

136. 
136. Homer, *Iliad* 18.489; *Odyssey* 5.275. There are several constellations other than the Great Bear \(Big Dipper\) rotating around the northern pole star that do not set below the horizon when viewed from the Mediterranean lands.

137. 
137. *Iliad* 2.15 and 23.328. In the first passage, Zeus sends a false dream to Agamemnon \(“we grant him”\) that he can conquer Troy if he moves quickly. It troubled many readers that Zeus would lie, so this unknown Hippias suggested a change of pronunciation of a single letter that changed the passage to “grant him,” though the permission to lie still comes from Zeus. In the second passage the aged Nestor gives advice to his son about how to win a chariot race by turning at a tree stump, either “the part rotted by rain” or “the part not rotted by rain,” depending on the pronunciation of one small Greek word.

138. 
138. In Greek, the word *prin* \(before\) can be taken with different parts of the line \(“unmixed before becomes mixed” or “mixed before becomes unmixed”\).

139. 
139. The line from Homer’s *Iliad* \(10.252\) is “more than two-thirds of the night is gone, but a third is left.” The problem is how more \(*pleô*\) than two-thirds can have passed if a third is still left. The solution apparently is to read *pleô* as “fully” or some similar sense.

140. 
140. *Iliad* 21.592. A greave is a piece of armor used to protect the shins of a warrior’s legs. They were called tin even though they were bronze, made from a mixture of tin and copper. Aristotle says this is like mixed wine being called “wine” even though it is mixed with water.

141. 
141. Homer, *Iliad* 20.234. Ganymede was the cupbearer to Zeus, who like the other gods drank nectar.

142. 
142. When a spear is thrown \(*Iliad* 20.272\) at the shield of Achilles—which has two layers of tin and one of gold—it reportedly pierces two layers but is stopped by the layer of gold. But the gold layer would presumably be on the outside of the shield for show. Aristotle must mean we should see the gold as stopping the spear in the sense that it began the process finished by the tin layers, but this is unclear.

143. 
143. Telemachus journeys to Sparta in *Odyssey* 4 to find news about his father, Odysseus.

144. 
144. In the *Medea*, Aegeus appears in the play for no other reason than to whisk Medea off to asylum in Athens.

145. 
145. Scholars aren’t able to agree on what exactly these twelve are.

146. 
146. Mynniscus acted in the mid-fifth century, while Callippides performed later in that century. We know nothing about Pindarus.

147. 
147. Epic poems were often performed by professionals called rhapsodes, though this particular individual is unknown.

148. 
148. In ancient Greece, as in Shakespeare’s day, the parts of women were played by men.

149. 
149. Here begins the lost second book of the *Poetics* in which Aristotle examined comedy.
